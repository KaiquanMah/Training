Changing the working directory
You are using an open-source library that lets you train deep neural networks on your data. Unfortunately, during training, this library writes out checkpoint models (i.e., models that have been trained on a portion of the data) to the current working directory. You find that behavior frustrating because you don't want to have to launch the script from the directory where the models will be saved.
You decide that one way to fix this is to write a context manager that changes the current working directory, lets you build your models, and then resets the working directory to its original location. You'll want to be sure that any errors that occur during model training don't prevent you from resetting the working directory to its original location.


Add a statement that lets you handle any errors that might occur inside the context.
Add a statement that ensures os.chdir(current_dir) will be called, whether there was an error or not.


def in_dir(directory):
  """Change current working directory to `directory`,
  allow the user to run some code, and change back.

  Args:
    directory (str): The path to a directory to work in.
  """
  current_dir = os.getcwd()
  os.chdir(directory)

  # Add code that lets you handle errors
  try:
    yield
  # Ensure the directory is reset,
  # whether there was an error or not
  finally:
    os.chdir(current_dir)


Excellent error handling! Now, even if someone writes buggy code when using your context manager, you will be sure to change the current working directory back to what it was when they called in_dir(). This is important to do because your users might be relying on their working directory being what it was when they started the script. in_dir() is a great example of the CHANGE/RESET pattern that indicates you should use a context manager.
