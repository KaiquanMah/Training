The timer() context manager
A colleague of yours is working on a web service that processes Instagram photos. Customers are complaining that the service takes too long to identify whether or not an image has a cat in it, so your colleague has come to you for help. You decide to write a context manager that they can use to time how long their functions take to run.

Add a decorator from the contextlib module to the timer() function that will make it act like a context manager.
Send control from the timer() function to the context block.

# Add a decorator that will make timer() a context manager
@contextlib.contextmanager
def timer():
  """Time the execution of a context block.

  Yields:
    None
  """
  start = time.time()
  # Send control back to the context block
  yield
  end = time.time()
  print('Elapsed: {:.2f}s'.format(end - start))

with timer():
  print('This should take approximately 0.25 seconds')
  time.sleep(0.25)


<script.py> output:
    This should take approximately 0.25 seconds
    Elapsed: 0.25s

You're managing context like a boss! And your colleague can now use your timer() context manager to figure out which of their functions is running too slow. Notice that the three elements of a context manager are all here: a function definition, a yield statement, and the @contextlib.contextmanager decorator. It's also worth noticing that timer() is a context manager that does not return an explicit value, so yield is written by itself without specifying anything to return.
