The speed of cats
You're working on a new web service that processes Instagram feeds to identify which pictures contain cats (don't ask why -- it's the internet). The code that processes the data is slower than you would like it to be, so you are working on tuning it up to run faster. Given an image, image, you have two functions that can process it:
process_with_numpy(image)
process_with_pytorch(image)


Your colleague wrote a context manager, timer(), that will print out how long the code inside the context block takes to run. She is suggesting you use it to see which of the two options is faster. Time each function to determine which one to use in your web service.
Use the timer() context manager to time how long process_with_numpy(image) takes to run.
Use the timer() context manager to time how long process_with_pytorch(image) takes to run.

image = get_image_from_instagram()

# Time how long process_with_numpy(image) takes to run
with timer():
  print('Numpy version')
  process_with_numpy(image)

# Time how long process_with_pytorch(image) takes to run
with timer():
  print('Pytorch version')
  process_with_pytorch(image)

<script.py> output:
    Numpy version
    Processing..........done!
    Elapsed: 1.52 seconds

    Pytorch version
    Processing..........done!
    Elapsed: 0.33 seconds

Terrific timing! Now that you know the pytorch version is faster, you can use it in your web service to ensure your users get the rapid response time they expect.

You may have noticed there was no as <variable name> at the end of the with statement in timer() context manager. That is because timer() is a context manager that does not return a value, so the as <variable name> at the end of the with statement isn't necessary. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to write your own context managers like timer().
