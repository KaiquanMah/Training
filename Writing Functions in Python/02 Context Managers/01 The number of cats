The number of cats
You are working on a natural language processing project to determine what makes great writers so great. Your current hypothesis is that great writers talk about cats a lot. To prove it, you want to count the number of times the word "cat" appears in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. You have already downloaded a text file, alice.txt, with the entire contents of this great book.


Use the open() context manager to open alice.txt and assign the file to the file variable.
# Open "alice.txt" and assign the file to "file"
with open('alice.txt') as file:
  text = file.read()

n = 0
for word in text.split():
  if word.lower() in ['cat', 'cats']:
    n += 1

print('Lewis Carroll uses the word "cat" {} times'.format(n))

<script.py> output:
    Lewis Carroll uses the word "cat" 24 times
Cool cat counting! By opening the file using the with open() statement, you were able to read in the text of the file. More importantly, when you were done reading the text, the context manager closed the file for you.
