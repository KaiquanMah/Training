Docstrings to the rescue!
Some maniac has corrupted your installation of numpy! All of the functions still exist, but they've been given random names. You desperately need to call the numpy.histogram() function and you don't have time to reinstall the package. Fortunately for you, the maniac didn't think to alter the docstrings, and you know how to access them. numpy has a lot of functions in it, so we've narrowed it down to four possible functions that could be numpy.histogram() in disguise: numpy.leyud(), numpy.uqka(), numpy.fywdkxa() or numpy.jinzyxq().
Examine each of these functions' docstrings in the IPython shell to determine which of them is actually numpy.histogram().
numpy.leyud()
numpy.uqka()
numpy.jinzyxq()

#YES - numpy.fywdkxa()
You found it! numpy.fywdkxa() is actually numpy.histogram() in disguise. If you've spent any time browsing numpy's online documentation, you will notice that it is built directly from the docstrings. There are some wonderful tools like sphinx and pydoc that will automatically generate online documentation for you based off of your docstrings.

Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Array to be reshaped.
newshape : int or tuple of ints
    The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
    an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
    One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
    inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
    Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
    elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
    means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
    with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
    axis index changing slowest. 'F' means to read / write the
    elements using Fortran-like index order, with the first index
    changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest. Note that
    the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout of
    the underlying array, and only refer to the order of indexing.
    'A' means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index
    order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
    otherwise.

Returns
-------
reshaped_array : ndarray
    This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will
    be a copy.  Note there is no guarantee of the *memory layout* (C- or
    Fortran- contiguous) of the returned array.

See Also
--------
ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.

Notes
-----
It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without
copying the data. If you want an error to be raised when the data is copied,
you should assign the new shape to the shape attribute of the array::

 >>> a = np.zeros((10, 2))
 # A transpose makes the array non-contiguous
 >>> b = a.T
 # Taking a view makes it possible to modify the shape without modifying
 # the initial object.
 >>> c = b.view()
 >>> c.shape = (20)
 AttributeError: incompatible shape for a non-contiguous array

The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for *fetching* the values
from `a`, and then *placing* the values into the output array.
For example, let's say you have an array:

>>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
>>> a
array([[0, 1],
       [2, 3],
       [4, 5]])

You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given
index order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the
new array using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the
raveling.

>>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
array([[0, 1, 2],
       [3, 4, 5]])
>>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape
array([[0, 1, 2],
       [3, 4, 5]])
>>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3), order='F') # Fortran-like index ordering
array([[0, 4, 3],
       [2, 1, 5]])
>>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a, order='F'), (2, 3), order='F')
array([[0, 4, 3],
       [2, 1, 5]])

Examples
--------
>>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
>>> np.reshape(a, 6)
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
>>> np.reshape(a, 6, order='F')
array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])

>>> np.reshape(a, (3,-1))       # the unspecified value is inferred to be 2
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4],
       [5, 6]])












In [5]: print(inspect.getdoc(numpy.uqka))
... 
Returns the indices that would sort an array.

Perform an indirect sort along the given axis using the algorithm specified
by the `kind` keyword. It returns an array of indices of the same shape as
`a` that index data along the given axis in sorted order.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Array to sort.
axis : int or None, optional
    Axis along which to sort.  The default is -1 (the last axis). If None,
    the flattened array is used.
kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
    Sorting algorithm.
order : str or list of str, optional
    When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
    which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
    be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
    but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
    they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

Returns
-------
index_array : ndarray, int
    Array of indices that sort `a` along the specified axis.
    If `a` is one-dimensional, ``a[index_array]`` yields a sorted `a`.
    More generally, ``np.take_along_axis(a, index_array, axis=a)`` always
    yields the sorted `a`, irrespective of dimensionality.

See Also
--------
sort : Describes sorting algorithms used.
lexsort : Indirect stable sort with multiple keys.
ndarray.sort : Inplace sort.
argpartition : Indirect partial sort.

Notes
-----
See `sort` for notes on the different sorting algorithms.

As of NumPy 1.4.0 `argsort` works with real/complex arrays containing
nan values. The enhanced sort order is documented in `sort`.

Examples
--------
One dimensional array:

>>> x = np.array([3, 1, 2])
>>> np.argsort(x)
array([1, 2, 0])

Two-dimensional array:

>>> x = np.array([[0, 3], [2, 2]])
>>> x
array([[0, 3],
       [2, 2]])

>>> np.argsort(x, axis=0)  # sorts along first axis (down)
array([[0, 1],
       [1, 0]])

>>> np.argsort(x, axis=1)  # sorts along last axis (across)
array([[0, 1],
       [0, 1]])

Indices of the sorted elements of a N-dimensional array:

>>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argsort(x, axis=None), x.shape)
>>> ind
(array([0, 1, 1, 0]), array([0, 0, 1, 1]))
>>> x[ind]  # same as np.sort(x, axis=None)
array([0, 2, 2, 3])

Sorting with keys:

>>> x = np.array([(1, 0), (0, 1)], dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])
>>> x
array([(1, 0), (0, 1)],
      dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])

>>> np.argsort(x, order=('x','y'))
array([1, 0])

>>> np.argsort(x, order=('y','x'))
array([0, 1])











In [6]: print(inspect.getdoc(numpy.fywdkxa))
... 
Compute the histogram of a set of data.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Input data. The histogram is computed over the flattened array.
bins : int or sequence of scalars or str, optional
    If `bins` is an int, it defines the number of equal-width
    bins in the given range (10, by default). If `bins` is a
    sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the rightmost
    edge, allowing for non-uniform bin widths.

    .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

    If `bins` is a string, it defines the method used to calculate the
    optimal bin width, as defined by `histogram_bin_edges`.

range : (float, float), optional
    The lower and upper range of the bins.  If not provided, range
    is simply ``(a.min(), a.max())``.  Values outside the range are
    ignored. The first element of the range must be less than or
    equal to the second. `range` affects the automatic bin
    computation as well. While bin width is computed to be optimal
    based on the actual data within `range`, the bin count will fill
    the entire range including portions containing no data.
normed : bool, optional

    .. deprecated:: 1.6.0

    This is equivalent to the `density` argument, but produces incorrect
    results for unequal bin widths. It should not be used.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
        DeprecationWarnings are actually emitted.

weights : array_like, optional
    An array of weights, of the same shape as `a`.  Each value in
    `a` only contributes its associated weight towards the bin count
    (instead of 1). If `density` is True, the weights are
    normalized, so that the integral of the density over the range
    remains 1.
density : bool, optional
    If ``False``, the result will contain the number of samples in
    each bin. If ``True``, the result is the value of the
    probability *density* function at the bin, normalized such that
    the *integral* over the range is 1. Note that the sum of the
    histogram values will not be equal to 1 unless bins of unity
    width are chosen; it is not a probability *mass* function.

    Overrides the ``normed`` keyword if given.

Returns
-------
hist : array
    The values of the histogram. See `density` and `weights` for a
    description of the possible semantics.
bin_edges : array of dtype float
    Return the bin edges ``(length(hist)+1)``.


See Also
--------
histogramdd, bincount, searchsorted, digitize, histogram_bin_edges

Notes
-----
All but the last (righthand-most) bin is half-open.  In other words,
if `bins` is::

  [1, 2, 3, 4]

then the first bin is ``[1, 2)`` (including 1, but excluding 2) and
the second ``[2, 3)``.  The last bin, however, is ``[3, 4]``, which
*includes* 4.


Examples
--------
>>> np.histogram([1, 2, 1], bins=[0, 1, 2, 3])
(array([0, 2, 1]), array([0, 1, 2, 3]))
>>> np.histogram(np.arange(4), bins=np.arange(5), density=True)
(array([ 0.25,  0.25,  0.25,  0.25]), array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))
>>> np.histogram([[1, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]], bins=[0,1,2,3])
(array([1, 4, 1]), array([0, 1, 2, 3]))

>>> a = np.arange(5)
>>> hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(a, density=True)
>>> hist
array([ 0.5,  0. ,  0.5,  0. ,  0. ,  0.5,  0. ,  0.5,  0. ,  0.5])
>>> hist.sum()
2.4999999999999996
>>> np.sum(hist * np.diff(bin_edges))
1.0

.. versionadded:: 1.11.0

Automated Bin Selection Methods example, using 2 peak random data
with 2000 points:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> rng = np.random.RandomState(10)  # deterministic random data
>>> a = np.hstack((rng.normal(size=1000),
...                rng.normal(loc=5, scale=2, size=1000)))
>>> plt.hist(a, bins='auto')  # arguments are passed to np.histogram
>>> plt.title("Histogram with 'auto' bins")
>>> plt.show()

... 
Return an array of zeros with the same shape and type as a given array.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
    the returned array.
dtype : data-type, optional
    Overrides the data type of the result.

    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
order : {'C', 'F', 'A', or 'K'}, optional
    Overrides the memory layout of the result. 'C' means C-order,
    'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
    'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
    as possible.

    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
subok : bool, optional.
    If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class
    type of 'a', otherwise it will be a base-class array. Defaults
    to True.

Returns
-------
