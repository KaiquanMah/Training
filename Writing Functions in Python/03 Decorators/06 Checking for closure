Checking for closure
You're teaching your niece how to program in Python, and she is working on returning nested functions. She thinks she has written the code correctly, but she is worried that the returned function won't have the necessary information when called. Show her that all of the nonlocal variables she needs are in the new function's closure.

Use an attribute of the my_func() function to show that it has a closure that is not None.
def return_a_func(arg1, arg2):
  def new_func():
    print('arg1 was {}'.format(arg1))
    print('arg2 was {}'.format(arg2))
  return new_func
    
my_func = return_a_func(2, 17)

# Show that my_func()'s closure is not None
print(my_func.__closure__ is not None)


<script.py> output:
    True








Show that there are two variables in the closure.
# Show that there are two variables in the closure
print(len(my_func.__closure__) == 2)

<script.py> output:
    True








Get the values of the variables in the closure so you can show that they are equal to [2, 17], the arguments passed to return_a_func().
# Get the values of the variables in the closure
closure_values = [
  my_func.__closure__[i].cell_contents for i in range(2)
]
print(closure_values == [2, 17])

<script.py> output:
    True
