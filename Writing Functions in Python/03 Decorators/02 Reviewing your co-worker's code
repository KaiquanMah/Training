Reviewing your co-worker's code
Your co-worker is asking you to review some code that they've written and give them some tips on how to get it ready for production. You know that having a docstring is considered best practice for maintainable, reusable functions, so as a sanity check you decide to run this has_docstring() function on all of their functions.

def has_docstring(func):
  """Check to see if the function 
  `func` has a docstring.

  Args:
    func (callable): A function.

  Returns:
    bool
  """
  return func.__doc__ is not None



Call has_docstring() on your co-worker's load_and_plot_data() function.
# Call has_docstring() on the load_and_plot_data() function
ok = has_docstring(load_and_plot_data)

if not ok:
  print("load_and_plot_data() doesn't have a docstring!")
else:
  print("load_and_plot_data() looks ok")
  
  
<script.py> output:
    load_and_plot_data() looks ok
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Check if the function as_2D() has a docstring.
# Call has_docstring() on the as_2D() function
ok = has_docstring(as_2D)

if not ok:
  print("as_2D() doesn't have a docstring!")
else:
  print("as_2D() looks ok")


<script.py> output:
    as_2D() looks ok
    
    
    
    
    
    

Check if the function log_product() has a docstring.
# Call has_docstring() on the log_product() function
ok = has_docstring(log_product)

if not ok:
  print("log_product() doesn't have a docstring!")
else:
  print("log_product() looks ok")


<script.py> output:
    log_product() doesn't have a docstring!



Awesome job writing functions as arguments! You have discovered that your co-worker forgot to write a docstring for log_product(). You have learned enough about best practices to tell them how to fix it.

To pass a function as an argument to another function, you had to determine which one you were calling and which one you were referencing. Keeping those straight will be important as we dig deeper into this chapter. From the function names can you think of any other advice you might give your co-worker about their functions?
