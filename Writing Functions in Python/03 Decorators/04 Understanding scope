Understanding scope
What four values does this script print?

x = 50

def one():
  x = 10

def two():
  global x
  x = 30

def three():
  x = 100
  print(x)

for func in [one, two, three]:
  func()
  print(x)





50, 30, 100, 50
10, 30, 30, 30
10, 30, 100, 50
50, 50, 50, 50

#YES - 50, 30, 100, 30
Good job! one() doesn't change the global x, so the first print() statement prints 50.

two() does change the global x so the second print() statement prints 30.

The print() statement inside the function three() is referencing the x value that is local to three(), so it prints 100.

But three() does not change the global x value so the last print() statement prints 30 again.
