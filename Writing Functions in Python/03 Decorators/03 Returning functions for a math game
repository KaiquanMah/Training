Returning functions for a math game
You are building an educational math game where the player enters a math term, and your program returns a function that matches that term. For instance, if the user types "add", your program returns a function that adds two numbers. So far you've only implemented the "add" function. Now you want to include a "subtract" function.


Define the subtract() function. It should take two arguments and return the first argument minus the second argument.
def create_math_function(func_name):
  if func_name == 'add':
    def add(a, b):
      return a + b
    return add
  elif func_name == 'subtract':
    # Define the subtract() function
    def subtract(a, b):
      return a - b
    return subtract
  else:
    print("I don't know that one")
    
add = create_math_function('add')
print('5 + 2 = {}'.format(add(5, 2)))

subtract = create_math_function('subtract')
print('5 - 2 = {}'.format(subtract(5, 2)))



<script.py> output:
    5 + 2 = 7
    5 - 2 = 3


Nice nested function! Now that you've implemented the subtract() function, you can keep going to include multiply() and divide(). I predict this game is going to be even bigger than Fortnite!

Notice how we assign the return value from create_math_function() to the add and subtract variables in the script. Since create_math_function() returns a function, we can then call those variables as functions.
