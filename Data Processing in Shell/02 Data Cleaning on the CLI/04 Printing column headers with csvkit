Printing column headers with csvkit
There are many ways to preview the data within csvkit alone(e.g. csvlook, csvstat, etc). However, if all we want is to find the position and name of the columns in our data, it is easier to simply print a string of column headers. Let's print the column headers for the data file Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv.


Print in console a list of column headers in the data file Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv using a csvkit command.
# Check to confirm name and location of data file
ls
Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv  backup  bin


# Print a list of column headers in data file 
csvcut --names Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv
  1: track_id
  2: danceability
  3: duration_ms
  4: instrumentalness
  5: loudness
  6: tempo
  7: time_signature

If you have trouble remember the name of a specific csvkit command, visit the web-based documentation page for csvkit. If you remember the command but are not sure how to use it, use -h or --help to pull up the command specific help page.
