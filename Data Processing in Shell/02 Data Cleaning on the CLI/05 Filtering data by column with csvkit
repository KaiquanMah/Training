Filtering data by column with csvkit
Let's get some hands-on practice for filtering data column using the csvkit command csvcut. Remember that we can filter columns by referring to the position of the column (e.g. 1st column, 2nd column) or by referring to the exact name of the column as it appears in the data file.


Print the first column in Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv by referring to the column by its position in the file.
# Print a list of column headers in the data 
csvcut -n Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv

# Print the first column, by position
csvcut -c 1 Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv
$ csvcut -c 1 Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv
