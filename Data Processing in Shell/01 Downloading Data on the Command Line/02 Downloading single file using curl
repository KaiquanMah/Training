Downloading single file using curl
Let's get some hands on practice for the more commonly used options and flags with curl. The URL for the hosted file is a shortened URL using tinyurl. Because of that, we need to fill out a flag option that allows for redirected URLs.


Fill in the option flag that allow downloading from a redirected URL.
# Use curl to download the file from the redirected URL
curl -L https://assets.dc.com/production/repositories/4180/datasets/eb1d6a36fa3039e4e00064797e1a1600d267b135/201812SpotifyData.zip





In the same step as the download, add in the necessary syntax to rename the downloaded file as Spotify201812.zip.
# Download and rename the file in the same step
curl -o Spotify201812.zip -L https://assets.dc.com/production/repositories/4180/datasets/eb1d6a36fa3039e4e00064797e1a1600d267b135/201812SpotifyData.zip

Great job! Remember that when in doubt, use man curl or curl --help to review the various options and flags available to you with curl
