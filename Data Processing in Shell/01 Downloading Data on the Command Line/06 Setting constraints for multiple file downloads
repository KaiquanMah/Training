Setting constraints for multiple file downloads
Which of the following is NOT the correct way to set download constraints for multiple file downloads using wget?


Use wget with the --limit-rate option, followed by the download speed in KB/s.
Use wget with the --wait option, followed by the wait time in seconds.

#not - Store all URL locations in a text file (e.g. url_list.txt) and iteratively download using wget and option flag i
"Correct! While wget -i url_list.txt is syntactically correct, this only iterates through the files but does not set any constraints for downloads."
