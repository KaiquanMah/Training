Scheduling a job with crontab
In this exercise, we will create a simple Python job and automate this job using CRONTAB so that it runs every minute.
If you're unsure of how to use cron or crontab, refer to https://crontab.guru for more documentation.

Verify that there are currently no CRON jobs currently scheduled via CRONTAB.
# Verify that there are no CRON jobs currently scheduled
crontab -l
no crontab for repl


Create a Python file called hello_world.py which prints "hello world" when executed.
# Create Python file hello_world.py
echo "print('hello world')" > hello_world.py

# Preview Python file 
cat hello_world.py
print('hello world')



Modify CRONTAB by adding a job that runs the Python script hello_world.py every minute on the minute.
# Add as job that runs every minute on the minute to crontab
echo "1 * * * * python hello_world.py" | crontab







Verify that the CRON job has been created successfully.
# Verify that the CRON job has been added
crontab -l
1 * * * * python hello_world.py
