Database and SQL with csvkit
The addition of csvsql and sql2csv allows us to go through an entire data workflow inside the terminal without needing to install and set up additional SQL clients and software. In this capstone, we will put together and pull data from a SQLite database, merge this data with a locally saved file, and finally, push a final merged file back to the database, all without ever leaving the command line.


Download the entire table SpotifyMostRecentData from the SQLite database SpotifyDatabase and save it as a csv file locally as SpotifyMostRecentData.csv.
# Store SQL for querying from SQLite database 
sqlquery_pull="SELECT * FROM SpotifyMostRecentData"

# Apply SQL to save table as local file 
sql2csv --db "sqlite:///SpotifyDatabase.db" --query "$sqlquery_pull" > SpotifyMostRecentData.csv










Manipulate the two local csv files SpotifyMostRecentData.csv and Spotify201812.csv by passing in the stored UNION ALL SQL query into csvsql. Save the newly created file as UnionedSpotifyData.csv.
# Store SQL for UNION of the two local CSV files
sqlquery_union="SELECT * FROM SpotifyMostRecentData UNION ALL SELECT * FROM Spotify201812"

# Apply SQL to union the two local CSV files and save as local file
csvsql 	--query "$sqlquery_union" SpotifyMostRecentData.csv Spotify201812.csv > UnionedSpotifyData.csv














Push the newly created csv file UnionedSpotifyData.csv back to database SpotifyDatabase as its own table.
# Push UnionedSpotifyData.csv to database as a new table
csvsql --db "sqlite:///SpotifyDatabase.db" --insert UnionedSpotifyData.csv

csvkit's ability to push and pull data from many SQL databases is one of the key reasons why it is so popular with data practitioners. These two tools are valuble adds to our toolkit for advanced data processing on the command line!
