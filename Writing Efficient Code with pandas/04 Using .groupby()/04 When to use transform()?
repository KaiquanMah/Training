When to use transform()?
The .transform() function applies a function to all members of each group. Which of the following transformations would produce the same results in the whole dataset regardless of groupings?

#NOT - lambda x: (x - x.min()) / (x.max() - x.min())
Are you sure? There is at least one group-related function in this answer.

#NOT - lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / (x.std())
Are you sure? There is at least one group-related function in this answer.

#NOT - lambda x: x
Are you sure? There is at least one group-related function in this answer.

#YES - lambda x: np.random.randint(0,10)
#this np random function gives a random # irrespective of what your x values are.
Congratulations! You know when to and when not to use the .transform() function.
