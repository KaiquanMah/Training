Replace single values II
For this exercise, we will be using the names DataFrame. In this dataset, the column 'Rank' shows the ranking of each name by year. For this exercise, you will use dictionaries to replace the first ranked name of every year as 'FIRST', the second name as 'SECOND' and the third name as 'THIRD'.
You will use dictionaries to replace one single value per key.
You can already see the first 5 names of the data, which correspond to the 5 most popular names for all the females belonging to the 'ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER' ethnicity in 2011.

   Year of Birth  Gender                   Ethnicity Child's First Name  Count  Rank
0           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER             SOPHIA    119     1
1           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER              CHLOE    106     2
2           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER              EMILY     93     3

4           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER               EMMA     75     5






Replace the ranks, indicated in numbers, by strings, following the pattern given above. Don't hesitate to explore your dataset in the Console after replacing values to see how it changed.
# Replace the number rank by a string
names['Rank'].replace({1:'FIRST', 2:'SECOND', 3:'THIRD'}, inplace=True)
print(names.head())

<script.py> output:
