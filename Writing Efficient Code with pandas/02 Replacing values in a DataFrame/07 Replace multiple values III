Replace multiple values III
As you saw in the video, you can use dictionaries to replace multiple values with just one value, even from multiple columns. To show the usefulness of replacing with dictionaries, you will use the names dataset one more time.
In this dataset, the column 'Rank' shows which rank each name reached every year. You will change the rank of the first three ranked names of every year to 'MEDAL' and those from 4th and 5th place to 'ALMOST MEDAL'.
You can already see the first 5 names of the data, which correspond to the 5 most popular names for all the females belonging to the 'ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER' ethnicity in 2011.

   Year of Birth  Gender                   Ethnicity Child's First Name  Count  Rank
0           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER             SOPHIA    119     1
1           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER              CHLOE    106     2
2           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER              EMILY     93     3
3           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER             OLIVIA     89     4
4           2011  FEMALE  ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER               EMMA     75     5



Replace the first three ranked names of every year to 'MEDAL'.
Replace the fourth and fifth ranked names of every year to 'ALMOST MEDAL'.

# Replace the rank of the first three ranked names to 'MEDAL'
names.replace({'Rank': {1:'MEDAL', 2:'MEDAL', 3:'MEDAL'}}, inplace=True)

# Replace the rank of the 4th and 5th ranked names to 'ALMOST MEDAL'
names.replace({'Rank': {4:'ALMOST MEDAL', 5:'ALMOST MEDAL'}}, inplace=True)
print(names.head())

<script.py> output:

Congratulations! You can now see how useful is to use dictionaries to replace different entries of a DataFrame with one specific value.
