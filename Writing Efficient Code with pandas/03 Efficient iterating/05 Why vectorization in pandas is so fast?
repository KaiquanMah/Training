Why vectorization in pandas is so fast?
As you probably noticed in this lesson, we achieved a massive improvement using some form of vectorization.

Where does this improvement come from?
Less lines of code needed.
More computational resources used.

#YES - Fewer operations are required due to optimization in pandas.
Congratulations! Vectorization is always the fastest option, and now you know why. Extra tip: It uses C code the optimal way!
