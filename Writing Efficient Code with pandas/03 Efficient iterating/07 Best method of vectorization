Best method of vectorization
So far, you have encountered two vectorization methods:
Vectorization over pandas Series
Vectorization over Numpy ndarrays

While these two methods outperform all the other methods, when can vectorization over NumPy ndarrays be used to replace vectorization over pandas Series?
Only when numerical data are involved.
Only when categorical data are involved.

#YES - When operations like indexing or data type are not used.
Congratulations! Vectorization over NumPy ndarrays is always the fastest option, and now you know why!
