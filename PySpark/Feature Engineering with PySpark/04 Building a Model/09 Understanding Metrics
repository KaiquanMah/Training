Understanding Metrics
Recall that R^2 and RMSE are both metrics to evaluate the performance of regression models. Both provide a different way to interpret the fit of our model. Which of the following statements is FALSE regarding R^2 or RMSE?

RMSE is comparable across predictions looking at the same dependent variable.
R^2 is comparable across predictions regardless of dependent variable.
RMSE is a measure of unexplained variance in the dependent variable.

#YES - R^2 is valued between 0 and 100
This is false, R^2 is valued between 0 and 1, where 0 is no better than chance and 1 is a perfect prediction.
