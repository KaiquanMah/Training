Feature Engineering For Random Forests
Considering what steps you'll need to take to preprocess your data before running a machine learning algorithm is important or you could get invalid results. Which of the following preprocessing techniques are needed for Random Forest Regression?

Scale all features between 0 and 1 with a min max scaler.
Ensure all variables are standard normal distributed, mean 0 and standard deviation of 1.
None of the above.

Perform value replacement for missing values and encode categorical text features to numeric.
#YES - Correct. Missing values are handled by Random Forests internally where they partition on missing values. As long as you replace them with something outside of the range of normal values, they will be handled correctly. Likewise, categorical features only need to be mapped to numbers, they are fine to stay all in one column by using a StringIndexer as we saw in chapter 3. OneHot encoding which converts each possible value to its own boolean feature is not needed.
