What are we predicting?
Which of these fields (or columns) is the value we are trying to predict for?
TAXES
SALESCLOSEPRICE
DAYSONMARKET
LISTPRICE



From the listed columns above, identify which one we will use as our dependent variable $Y$.
Using the loaded data set df, filter it down to our dependent variable with select(). Store this dataframe in the variable Y_df.
Display summary statistics for the dependent variable using describe() on Y_df and calling show() to display it.


# Select our dependent variable
Y_df = df.select(['SALESCLOSEPRICE'])

# Display summary statistics
Y_df.describe().show()



<script.py> output:
    +-------+------------------+

Correct! We want to know how much a house will actually sell for. We can see the range of values it has here and the average which will help us in our next steps!
