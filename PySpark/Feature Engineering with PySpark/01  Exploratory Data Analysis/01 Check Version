Where to begin?
Getting a new data set can be daunting and it can be easy to dive right in. What are first steps you should take when considering a new or unknown data set?

Run summary statistics on the entire dataset.
Research and fine definitions of all fields available.
Pairwise plot all fields in the dataset with your dependent variable.
Research your data; be curious, ask questions.

#yes - Define goals of analysis.
Correct! Understanding what question is driving your analysis is the first thing you should be focused on.








Check Version
Checking the version of which Spark and Python installed is important as it changes very quickly and drastically. Reading the wrong documentation can cause lots of lost time and unnecessary frustration!
This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the PySpark Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

Print the Spark version.
Print the Python version_info.

# Return spark version
print(spark.version)
#major.minor.patch

# Return python version
import sys
print(sys.version_info)


<script.py> output:
    2.3.1
    sys.version_info(major=3, minor=5, micro=2, releaselevel='final', serial=0)

Great, checking the version of your environment is important. Not only will it help you make sure you are using the latest documents but often PySpark has major new features in newer versions!
