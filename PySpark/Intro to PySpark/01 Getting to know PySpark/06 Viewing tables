Viewing tables
Once you've created a SparkSession, you can start poking around to see what data is in your cluster!
Your SparkSession has an attribute called catalog which lists all the data inside the cluster. This attribute has a few methods for extracting different pieces of information.
One of the most useful is the .listTables() method, which returns the names of all the tables in your cluster as a list.


See what tables are in your cluster by calling spark.catalog.listTables() and printing the result!
# Print the tables in the catalog
print(spark.catalog.listTables())

<script.py> output:
    [Table(name='flights', 
    database=None, 
    description=None, 
    tableType='TEMPORARY', 
    isTemporary=True)]
