Train-test split
To objectively assess a Machine Learning model you need to be able to test it on an independent set of data. You can't use the same data that you used to train the model: of course the model will perform (relatively) well on those data!

You will split the data into two components:
training data (used to train the model) and
testing data (used to test the model).

Randomly split the flights data into two sets with 80:20 proportions. For repeatability set a random number seed of 17 for the split.
Check that the training data has roughly 80% of the records from the original data.



# Split into training and testing sets in a 80:20 ratio
flights_train, flights_test = flights.randomSplit([0.8,0.2], seed=17)

# Check that training set has around 80% of records
training_ratio = flights_train.count() / flights.count()
print(training_ratio)



<script.py> output:
    0.7954448701575139
    
The ratio looks as expected. You're ready to train and test a Decision Tree model!
