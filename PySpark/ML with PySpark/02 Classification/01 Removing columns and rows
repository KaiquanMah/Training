Removing columns and rows
You previously loaded airline flight data from a CSV file. You're going to develop a model which will predict whether or not a given flight will be delayed.

In this exercise you need to trim those data down by:
removing an uninformative column and
removing rows which do not have information about whether or not a flight was delayed.
Note:: You might find it useful to revise the slides from the lessons in the Slides panel next to the IPython Shell.


Remove the flight column.
Find out how many records have missing values in the delay column.
Remove records with missing values in the delay column.
Remove records with missing values in any column and get the number of remaining rows.

# Remove the 'flight' column
flights = flights.drop('flight')

# Number of records with missing 'delay' values
flights.filter('delay IS NULL').count()
Out[1]: 2978


# Remove records with missing 'delay' values
flights = flights.filter('delay IS NOT NULL')

# Remove records with missing values in any column and get the number of remaining rows
flights = flights.dropna()
print(flights.count())
<script.py> output:
    47022


You've discarded the columns and rows which will certainly not contribute to a model.
