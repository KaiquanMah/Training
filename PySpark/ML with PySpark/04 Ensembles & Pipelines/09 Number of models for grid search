How many models for grid search?
How many models will be built when the cross-validator below is fit to data?

params = ParamGridBuilder().addGrid(hasher.numFeatures, [1024, 4096, 16384]) \
                           .addGrid(hasher.binary, [True, False]) \
                           .addGrid(logistic.regParam, [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0]) \
                           .addGrid(logistic.elasticNetParam, [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]) \
                           .build()

cv = CrossValidator(..., estimatorParamMaps=params, numFolds=5)



# grid points = 3 x 2 x 4 x 3
              = 72


# models = 72 x 5 Folds
         = 360


Correct! There are 72 points in the parameter grid and 5 folds in the cross-validator. The product is 360. It takes time to build all of those models, which is why we're not doing it here!
