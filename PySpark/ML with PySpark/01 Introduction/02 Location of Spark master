Location of Spark master
Which of the following is not a valid way to specify the location of a Spark cluster?

spark://13.59.151.161:7077
spark://ec2-18-188-22-23.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7077
local
local[4]
local[*]

#YES - spark://18.188.22.23
A Spark URL must always include a port number, so this URL is not valid.
