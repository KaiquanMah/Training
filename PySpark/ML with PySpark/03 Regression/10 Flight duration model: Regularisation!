Flight duration model: Regularisation!
In the previous exercise you added more predictors to the flight duration model. The model performed well on testing data, but with so many coefficients it was difficult to interpret.
In this exercise you'll use Lasso regression (regularized with a L1 penalty) to create a more parsimonious model. Many of the coefficients in the resulting model will be set to zero. This means that only a subset of the predictors actually contribute to the model. Despite the simpler model, it still produces a good RMSE on the testing data.
You'll use a specific value for the regularization strength. Later you'll learn how to find the best value using cross validation.
The data (same as previous exercise) are available as flights, randomly split into flights_train and flights_test.


Fit a linear regression model to the training data.
Calculate the RMSE on the testing data.
Look at the model coefficients.
How many of the coefficients are equal to zero?



from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

# Fit Lasso model (Î± = 1) to training data
regression = LinearRegression(labelCol='duration', regParam=1, elasticNetParam=1).fit(flights_train)

# Calculate the RMSE on testing data
rmse = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='duration').evaluate(regression.transform(flights_test))
print("The test RMSE is", rmse)

# Look at the model coefficients
coeffs = regression.coefficients
print(coeffs)

# Number of zero coefficients
zero_coeff = sum([beta == 0 for beta in regression.coefficients])
print("Number of coefficients equal to 0:", zero_coeff)



Regularisation produced a far simpler model with similar test performance.


    The test RMSE is 11.221618112066176
