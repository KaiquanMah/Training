Immutability review
Youâ€™ve just seen that immutability and lazy processing are fundamental concepts in the way Spark handles data. But why would Spark use immutable data frames to begin with?

To add complexity to your Spark tasks.
To easily modify variable values as needed.
To conserve storage space.

#YES - To efficiently handle data throughout the cluster.
Spark takes advantage of data immutability to efficiently share / create new data representations throughout the cluster.
