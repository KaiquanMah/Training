Filtering Question #2
Consider the following Data Frame called users_df:

ID	    Name	A   ge	State
140	    George L	47	Iowa
3260	  Mary R	  34	Vermont
18502	  Audrey V	68	Ohio
999	    Rick W	  23	California
If we wanted to return only the Name and State fields for any ID greater than 3000, which code snippet meets these requirements?

users_df.select("Name", "State").filter('ID > 3000')
users_df.filter(users_df.ID = 3260).filter(users_df.ID = 18502)
```users_df.select("Name", "State")

#yes - users_df.filter('ID > 3000').select("Name", "State")
Nice job! On first glance, either of the first two answers appear like they would work. If the .select() transformation is run first, there is not an ID column present to filter on. These types of errors are easy to miss when running Spark tasks.
