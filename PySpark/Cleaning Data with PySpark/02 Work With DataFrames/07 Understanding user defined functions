Understanding user defined functions
When creating a new user defined function, which is not a possible value for the second argument?

ArrayType(IntegerType())
IntegerType()
LongType()
StringType()

udf()
Good - you've demonstrated an understanding of what a UDF is actually doing. The return type from a UDF can be any defined type, even a full StructType() schema object.
