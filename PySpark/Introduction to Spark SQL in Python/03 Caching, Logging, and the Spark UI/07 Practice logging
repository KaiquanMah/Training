The following code is executed on startup:

import logging
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='%(levelname)s - %(message)s')
                    
                    
                    
You will now practice these logging operations.

Log columns of text_df as debug message.
Log whether table1 is cached as info message.
Log first row of text_df as warning message.
Log selected columns of text_df as error message.




# Log columns of text_df as debug message
logging.debug("text_df columns: %s", text_df.columns)

# Log whether table1 is cached as info message
logging.info("table1 is cached: %s", spark.catalog.isCached(tableName="table1"))

# Log first row of text_df as warning message
logging.warn("The first row of text_df:\n %s", text_df.first())

# Log selected columns of text_df as error message
logging.error("Selected columns: %s", text_df.select("id", "word"))
