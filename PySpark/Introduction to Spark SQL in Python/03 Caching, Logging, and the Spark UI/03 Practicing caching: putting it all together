What was the best approach to caching df1 and df2 and why?

Your results will vary; but here is one (random) result for each of the two approaches:

First answer (cache df1):
df1_1st : 2.4s
df1_2nd : 0.1s
df2_1st : 0.3s
df2_2nd : 0.2s
Overall elapsed : 3.9


Second answer (cache df2):
df1_1st : 2.3s
df1_2nd : 1.1s
df2_1st : 1.7s
df2_2nd : 0.1s
Overall elapsed : 6.4


Answer the question
Possible Answers
1
Cache df1, because it improves time of the first action the most.


2
Cache df2, because it also causes df1 to be cached.


#YES 3
#Cache df1, because it improves the time of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th action.

#own explanation
#cache df1 improves df1 running times
#cache df1 also improves df2 running times (which depends on df1's results and performance)



4
Cache df2, because it gives the best overall time.
