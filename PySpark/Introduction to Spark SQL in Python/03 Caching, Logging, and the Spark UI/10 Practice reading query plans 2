Practice reading query plans 2
Three dataframes are available: part2_df, part3_df, and part4_df. The questions posed in this exercise can be answered by inspecting the explain() output of each dataframe.
Note that Spark tags each column name with a descriptor, delimited by a # symbol. For example, word#0, id#1L, part#2, and title#3. For the purpose of this exercise, these descriptors can be ignored.


1
part2_df.explain()
ERROR! Session/line number was not unique in database. History logging moved to new session 15
== Physical Plan ==
*(1) Project [word#0, id#1L, part#2, title#3]
+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(part#2) && (part#2 = 2))
   +- *(1) FileScan parquet [word#0,id#1L,part#2,title#3] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/tmp/tmp36khp7f6/sherlock_parts.parquet], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(part), EqualTo(part,2)], ReadSchema: struct<word:string,id:bigint,part:int,title:string>

Question
What file was part2_df loaded from? The full path is not wanted here, we want only the filename and its extension.
Possible Answers
-/tmp/tmp212v0fcm/sherlock_parts.parquet
-'sherlock.parquet'
-InMemoryFileIndex
#YES - 'sherlock_parts.parquet'

part3_df.explain()
== Physical Plan ==
InMemoryTableScan [word#8, id#9L, part#10, title#11]
   +- InMemoryRelation [word#8, id#9L, part#10, title#11], StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)
         +- *(1) Project [word#8, id#9L, part#10, title#11]
            +- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(part#10) && (part#10 = 4))
               +- *(1) FileScan parquet [word#8,id#9L,part#10,title#11] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/tmp/tmpb3sfjbo3/sherlock_parts.parquet], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(part), EqualTo(part,4)], ReadSchema: struct<word:string,id:bigint,part:int,title:string>
               
Question
part3_df has a bug. part3_df was supposedly loaded with column part = 3. Select the integer value that is actually loaded.
Possible Answers
#YES - 4
-part#10
-part#4
-(part,4)

part4_df.explain()
== Physical Plan ==
*(1) FileScan parquet [word#36,id#37L] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:/tmp/tmphav41_zm/sherlock.parquet], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<word:string,id:bigint>


Question
What file was part4_df loaded from? The full path is not wanted here, we want only the filename and its extension.
Possible Answers
-'sherlock_parts.parquet'
-file:/tmp/tmpkq34jee3/sherlock.parquet
#YES - 'sherlock.parquet'
-sherlock_parts

Question
The ReadSchema property tells us the schema of the dataframe that was loaded. Give the value of the ReadSchema property of part4_df.
Possible Answers
-'word#84,id#85L'
-/tmp/tmp07lrcp7y/sherlock.parquet
-'struct<word:bigint,id:string>'
#YES - 'struct<word:string,id:bigint>'
