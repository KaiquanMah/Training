A simple while loop
A while loop is another control structure, like if/else. while lets us automate the repetition of instructions to make our code more readable and concise.

In this exercise, you will write a while loop that loops three times. Using an incrementing counter variable and if/else logic, you will print "winner" in the first iteration of the loop, "winner" again in the second iteration, and "chicken dinner" in the third and final iteration. This printed message won't be used in the Twenty-One program exactly, though it could be used in the context of congratulating a player if they win a round.


// Define counter variable
var i = 0

// Define the number of loop iterations
val numRepetitions = 3

// Loop to print a message for winner of the round
while (i < numRepetitions) {
  if (i < 2)
    println("winner")
  else
    println("chicken dinner")
  // Increment the counter variable
  i += 1
}


i: Int = 3
numRepetitions: Int = 3
winner
winner
chicken dinner

Nicely done. You practiced syntax of while as well as your understanding of the state of the computer as it is executed. What's the deal with "winner winner chicken dinner", you ask? The origin of the phrase is debated, but the most popular story is that a chicken dinner at a Las Vegas casino used to cost $2, which was the same amount as a standard bet. If you won a bet, you won a chicken dinner.






















Loop over a collection with while
The while construct causes the block of code between its curly braces to be executed repeatedly until the boolean expression at the top becomes false.

In the previous lesson, you created the body of the pointsToBust function to calculate the specific number of points. In this exercise, you'll write a while loop that loops through five hands (one for each player in the game) and finds the number of points to bust for each. Writing this while loop instead of calling the pointsToBust function five times makes our program more concise and readable.


// Define counter variable
var i = 0

// Create list with five hands of Twenty-One
var hands = List(16, 21, 8, 25, 4)

// Loop through hands
while (i < hands.length) {
  // Find and print number of points to bust
  println(pointsToBust(hands(i)))
  // Increment the counter variable
  i += 1
}


i: Int = 5
hands: List[Int] = List(16, 21, 8, 25, 4)
5
0
13
