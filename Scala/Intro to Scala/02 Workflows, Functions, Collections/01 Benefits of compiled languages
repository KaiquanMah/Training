Benefits of compiled languages
The following are commonly listed benefits of Scala being a compiled language. What was the main benefit cited in the video?


# The Scala compiler is able to infer type (for variables and collections, for example) so programmers can choose to omit type annotations to make their code more concise.
# The Scala compiler is able to infer semicolons so programmers can choose to omit them to make their code more concise.

# YES Compiled code performs better (i.e., is faster). This performance boost tend to grow in importance as program size grows.
#Right! The main benefit of compiled code is that it's faster, which becomes evident in large programs. The drawback is that it takes time to do the compiling, sometimes on the order of minutes for large Scala programs. This trade-off is usually worth it, especially for applications with pieces of code that will be run many many times (example: Twitter).



# Compile times are getting faster, with a 5-10% improvement made in a recent release.
