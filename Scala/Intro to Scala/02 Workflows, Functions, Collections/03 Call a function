Call a function
Now it's time to actually use a function! As a reminder, here is the maxHand function that finds the maximum hand value between two hands (ignoring whether or not each hand busts):

def maxHand(handA: Int, handB: Int): Int = {
  if (handA > handB) handA
  else handB
}
In this exercise, you'll create a variable to add the cards in each hand together, then call maxHand and pass in those variables as arguments to determine the maximum hand value. The maxHand function and the card variables you need are already defined.





// Calculate hand values
var handPlayerA: Int = queenDiamonds + threeClubs + aceHearts + fiveSpades
var handPlayerB: Int = kingHearts + jackHearts

// Find and print the maximum hand value
println(maxHand(handPlayerA, handPlayerB))



handPlayerA: Int = 19
handPlayerB: Int = 20
20


You called a function even without fully being comfortable with if expressions, which you'll see later in the course. All functions produce results, and all results have values, and all values have value types, and the maxHand function is no exception (its result has the Int value type). In future courses, you'll understand the full anatomy of a function (like parameters and type annotations), create your own functions, and more.
