Scala is object-oriented
Scala is an object-oriented language because every value is an object and every operation is a method call. This fact means the following lines of code both result in the value 6:

val sumB = 2.+(4)
val sumA = 2 + 4

The same principle applies to the subtraction operator (-), as operators are methods in Scala. In this exercise, you'll experience how Scala is object-oriented by converting code that Scala executes behind-the-scenes to the code you'll normally write in practice.




// Calculate the difference between 8 and 5
val difference = 8.-(5)

// Print the difference
println(difference)


//difference: Int = 3
//3





val difference2 = 8-5
println(difference2)

//difference2: Int = 3
//3


//You just experienced Scala being object-oriented. 
//The value 8 is an object, which has a subtraction method (.-()). 
//In this example, the value 5 is supplied to that method that is called. 
//If you're new to the language, you also just wrote your first Scala code. Congrats!
