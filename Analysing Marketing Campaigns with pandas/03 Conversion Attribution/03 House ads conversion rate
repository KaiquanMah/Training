House ads conversion rate
The house ads team has become worried about some irregularities they've noticed in conversion rate. It is common for stakeholders to come to you with concerns they've noticed around changing metrics. As a data scientist, it's your job to determine whether these changes are natural fluctuations or if they require further investigation.
In this exercise, you'll try out your conversion_rate() and plotting_conv() functions out on marketing looking at conversion rate by 'date_served' and 'marketing_channel'.

# Calculate conversion rate by date served and channel
daily_conv_channel = conversion_rate(marketing, ['date_served', 'marketing_channel'])

print(daily_conv_channel.head())
<script.py> output:
    date_served  marketing_channel

                 Facebook             0.117647
                 House Ads            0.084656

Unstack daily_conv_channel with level equal to one and convert the result into a DataFrame.
Try out your plotting_conv() function on daily_conv_channel.


# Calculate conversion rate by date served and channel
daily_conv_channel = conversion_rate(marketing, ['date_served', 
                                                 'marketing_channel'])

# Unstack daily_conv_channel and convert it to a DataFrame
daily_conv_channel = pd.DataFrame(daily_conv_channel.unstack(level = 1))

# Plot results of daily_conv_channel
plotting_conv(daily_conv_channel)
