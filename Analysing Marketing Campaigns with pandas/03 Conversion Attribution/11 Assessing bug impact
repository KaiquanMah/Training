Assessing bug impact
It's time to calculate how many subscribers were lost due to mistakenly serving users English rather than their preferred language. Once the team has an estimate of the impact of this error, they can determine whether it's worth putting additional checks in place to avoid this in the futureâ€”you might be thinking, of course, it's worth it to try to prevent errors! In a way, you're right, but every choice a company makes requires work and funding. The more information your team has, the better they will be able to evaluate this trade-off.
The DataFrame converted has already been loaded for you. It contains expected subscribers columns for Spanish, Arabic and German language speakers named expected_spanish_conv, expected_arabic_conv and expected_german_conv respectively.

Create the converted DataFrame by using .loc to select only rows where the date is between '2018-01-11' and '2018-01-31'.
Sum the expected subscribers columns for each language in converted and store the results in expected_subs.
Sum the actual subscribers for each language in converted and store the results in actual_subs.
Subtract actual_subs from expected_subs to determine how many subscribers were lost due to the bug.

32 subscribers may not seem like many, but for a small company this can be vitally important, especially when expanding to new markets.
