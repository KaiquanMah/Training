House ads conversion by language
Now that you've ruled out natural fluctuations across the day of the week a user saw our marketing assets as they cause for decreasing house ads conversion, you will take a look at conversion by language over time. Perhaps the new marketing campaign does not apply broadly across different cultures.
Ideally, the marketing team will consider cultural differences prior to launching a campaign, but sometimes mistakes are made, and it will be your job to identify the cause. Often data scientists are the first line of defense to determine what went wrong with a marketing campaign. It's your job to think creatively to identify the cause.

Create a new DataFrame house_ads by isolating the rows from marketing where marketing_channel equals 'House Ads'.
Run your conversion_rate() function on the house_ads DataFrame grouping by date_served and language_displayed.
Use the plotting_conv() function on conv_lang_df to display your results.

# Isolate the rows where marketing channel is House Ads
house_ads = marketing[marketing['marketing_channel'] == 'House Ads']

# Calculate conversion by date served, and language displayed
conv_lang_channel = conversion_rate(house_ads, ['date_served', 'language_displayed'])

# Unstack conv_lang_channel
conv_lang_df = pd.DataFrame(conv_lang_channel.unstack(level=1))

# Use your plotting function to display results
plotting_conv(conv_lang_df)

As you can see, the English conversion rate drops around the 11th, and there do not appear to be ads served in other languages for a two week period. You will investigate further.
