Calculating retention rate
In this exercise, you will calculate the retention rate, or the number of remaining subscribers from the users who converted to your product. This can give you a sense of whether your marketing campaign converted subscribers who were actually interested in the product.
Conversion rate and retention rate function hand-in-hand; you could create a business with a high conversion rate by giving users a free trial, but have a low retention rate once users are charged for your services. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but it is important to provide your business stakeholders with insight into what percentage of users remain subscribers.
The formula for retention rate is:
Number of people who remain subscribed/Total number of people who converted


Calculate the number of subscribers using the user_id and converted columns in the marketing DataFrame.
Calculate the number of retained subscribers using the boolean columns user_id and is_retained.
Calculate the retention rate.

In [9]: marketing['is_retained'].unique()
Out[9]: array([ True, False])

# Calculate the number of subscribers
total_subscribers = marketing['user_id'][marketing['converted'] == 'True'].value_counts()

# Calculate the number of people who remained subscribed
retained = marketing['user_id'][marketing['is_retained'] == 'True'].value_counts()


# Calculate the retention rate
retention_rate = retained/total_subscribers
print(round(retention_rate*100, 2), "%")

Much like with conversion rate, there is no retention rate that will apply across businesses and industries. Look at historical retention rates or retention rates of companies in a similar industry to interpret your results.
