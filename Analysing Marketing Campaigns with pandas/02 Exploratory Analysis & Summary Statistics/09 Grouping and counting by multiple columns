Grouping and counting by multiple columns
Stakeholders have begun competing to see whose channel had the best retention rate from the campaign. You must first determine how many subscribers came from the campaign and how many of those subscribers have stayed on the service.
It's important to identify how each marketing channel is performing because this will affect company strategy going forward. If one channel is outperforming others, it might signal the channel merits further investment.
You will build on what we have learned about .groupby() in previous exercises, this time grouping by multiple columns.

Use .groupby() to calculate subscribers by subscribing_channel and date_subscribed.
# Count the subs by subscribing channel and day
retention_total = marketing.groupby(['date_subscribed',
                                     'subscribing_channel'])['user_id'].nunique()

# Print results
print(retention_total.head())
<script.py> output:
    date_subscribed  subscribing_channel
    2018-01-01       Email                   1
                     Facebook                8
                     House Ads              16
                     Instagram               8
                     Push                    3
    Name: user_id, dtype: int64
    
    








Use .groupby() to calculate retained subscribers by subscribing_channel and date_subscribed.
In [1]: marketing.columns.values

       'converted', 'language_displayed', 'language_preferred',
       'age_group', 'date_subscribed', 'date_canceled',

# Sum the retained subs by subscribing channel and date subscribed
retention_subs = marketing[marketing['is_retained'] == True].groupby(['date_subscribed', 'subscribing_channel'])['user_id'].nunique()



# Print results
print(retention_subs.head())       

<script.py> output:
    date_subscribed  subscribing_channel
    2018-01-01       Email                   1

You've practiced grouping and counting by multiple columns. Next, you will visualize the retention results.
