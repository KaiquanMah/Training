Comparing language conversion rate (I)
The marketing team wants to determine how effective the campaign was on converting English speakers.
In this exercise, you will isolate the data for English speakers and calculate the conversion rate much like in the previous exercises. Remember, the formula for conversion rate is:
Number of people who convertTotal number of people who we market to
Once you have the conversion rate for English speakers, you can compare it to the overall conversion rate to gain a sense of how effective the marketing campaign was among this group compared to the overall population.

Using the marketing DataFrame, include only the rows where language_displayed is English.
Calculate the total number of users in the english_speakers DataFrame.
Calculate the number of conversions in the english_speakers DataFrame.

# Isolate english speakers
english_speakers = marketing[marketing['language_displayed'] == 'English']

# Calculate the total number of English speaking users
total = english_speakers['user_id'].nunique()

# Calculate the number of English speakers who converted
subscribers = english_speakers[english_speakers['converted'] ==True]['user_id'].nunique()


In [10]: total
Out[10]: 7169

In [11]: subscribers
Out[11]: 941





# Calculate conversion rate
conversion_rate = subscribers/total
print('English speaker conversion rate:', round(conversion_rate*100,2), '%')

English speaker conversion rate: 13.13 %


Next, you will compare English to the rest of the languages in the dataset. When we make this comparison across languages, we can get a sense of which languages convert well relative to others.
