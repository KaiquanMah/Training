Calculating conversion rate
In this exercise, you will practice calculating conversion rate, which is often the first metric you'll want to calculate when evaluating how a marketing campaign performed.
On marketing teams, conversion rate is typically the most important metric. It is one of the best ways to determine how effective a marketing team was at gaining new customers.
As a reminder, conversion rate is the percentage of the users who saw our marketing assets and subsequently became subscribers.
The formula for conversion rate is:
Number of people who convert/Total number of people who we market to

Calculate the number of unique user_ids in marketing DataFrame.
Calculate the number of people who subscribed using the converted column.
Calculate the conversion rate.

In [16]: marketing['converted'].unique()

# Calculate the number of people we marketed to
total = marketing['user_id'].nunique()

# Calculate the number of people who subscribed
subscribers = marketing[marketing['converted'] == 'True']['user_id'].value_counts()

# Calculate the conversion rate
conversion_rate = subscribers/total
print(round(conversion_rate*100, 2), "%")


You might be wondering, is this a good conversion rate? This will depend heavily on your business. There is no particular number that all marketing teams are trying to reach. Instead, when you're working on a marketing team, it helps to look at historical data to determine whether a conversion rate is what you would expect.
