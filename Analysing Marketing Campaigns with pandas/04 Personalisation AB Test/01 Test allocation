Determining key metrics
When running an A/B test when is the right time to determine key success metrics?


Once all the data has come in, and we can see which metrics our test affected.
I'll leave that to my marketing stakeholders.

#yes When designing the experiment.
Right. The earlier you define what success looks like, the better.











Test allocation
The email portion of this campaign was actually run as an A/B test. Half the emails sent out were generic upsells to your product while the other half contained personalized messaging around the usersâ€™ usage of the site.
Before you begin analyzing the results, you will check to ensure users were allocated equally to the test and control groups.

In [4]: email.columns.values
Out[4]: 
array(['user_id', 'date_served', 'marketing_channel', 'variant',
       'converted', 'language_displayed', 'language_preferred',
       'age_group', 'date_subscribed', 'date_canceled',
       'subscribing_channel', 'is_retained', 'DoW', 'channel_code',
       'is_correct_lang'], dtype=object)


# Subset the DataFrame
email = marketing[marketing['marketing_channel'] == 'Email']

# Group the email DataFrame by variant 
alloc = email.groupby(['variant'])['user_id'].nunique()


In [6]: alloc
Out[6]: 
variant
control            270
personalization    284
Name: user_id, dtype: int64


# Plot a bar chart of the test allocation
alloc.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Personalization test allocation')
plt.ylabel('# participants')
plt.show()


There's a slight difference in allocation, but it's within the expected range so you can continue with your analysis.
