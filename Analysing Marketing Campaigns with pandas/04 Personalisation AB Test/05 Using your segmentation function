Using your segmentation function
Now that you've generated an ab_segmentation() function, it's time to test it out.
Often a treatment will not affect all people uniformly. Some people will love a particular marketing campaign while others hate it. As a marketing data scientist, it's your responsibility to enable your marketing stakeholders to target users according to their preferences.
We will run through two segments in our data that may be relevant to assessing the impact of our test.
When using the ab_segmentation() function, remember to input the column name in quotes (i.e., 'language_displayed')

Run our ab_segmentation() function on 'language_displayed'.
# Use ab_segmentation on language displayed
ab_segmentation('language_displayed')

You found that personalization was extremely effective for younger groups but less effective than the control for older groups. One explanation might be that younger users understand how their data might be used online and think personalization is cool because it gives them more insight into themselves while older people might feel that this is a violation of their privacy.
