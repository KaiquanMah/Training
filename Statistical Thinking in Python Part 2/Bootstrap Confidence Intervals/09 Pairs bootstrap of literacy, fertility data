# Using the function you just wrote, perform pairs bootstrap to plot a histogram describing the estimate of the slope from the illiteracy/fertility data. Also report the 95% confidence interval of the slope. The data is available to you in the NumPy arrays illiteracy and fertility.
# As a reminder, draw_bs_pairs_linreg() has a function signature of draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1), and it returns two values: bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps.


# Generate replicates of slope and intercept using pairs bootstrap
#Use your draw_bs_pairs_linreg() function to take 1000 bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept. The x-axis data is illiteracy and y-axis data is fertility.
bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps = draw_bs_pairs_linreg(illiteracy,fertility,1000)

# Compute and print 95% CI for slope
print(np.percentile(bs_slope_reps, [2.5, 97.5]))

# Plot and show a histogram of the slope replicates
_ = plt.hist(bs_slope_reps, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('slope')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.show()
