# In this exercise, you will generate bootstrap samples from the set of annual rainfall data measured at the Sheffield Weather Station in the UK from 1883 to 2015. The data are stored in the NumPy array rainfall in units of millimeters (mm). By graphically displaying the bootstrap samples with an ECDF, you can get a feel for how bootstrap sampling allows probabilistic descriptions of data.

#Write a for loop to acquire 50 bootstrap samples of the rainfall data and plot their ECDF.
for _ in range(50):
    #Use np.random.choice() to generate a bootstrap sample from the NumPy array rainfall. Be sure that the size of the resampled array is len(rainfall).
    # Generate bootstrap sample: bs_sample
    bs_sample = np.random.choice(rainfall, len(rainfall))

    #Plot the ECDF values. Specify color='gray' (to make gray dots) and alpha=0.1 (to make them semi-transparent, since we are overlaying so many) in addition to the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
    # Compute and plot ECDF from bootstrap sample
    x, y = ecdf(bs_sample)
    _ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='gray', alpha=0.1)

# Compute and plot ECDF from original data
x, y = ecdf(rainfall)
_ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.')

# Make margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('yearly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
