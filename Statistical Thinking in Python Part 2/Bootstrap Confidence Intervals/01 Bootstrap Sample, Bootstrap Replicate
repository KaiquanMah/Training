#01 Bootstrap Sample, Bootstrap Replicate
# Getting tripped up over terminology is a common cause of frustration in students. Unfortunately, you often will read and hear other data scientists using different terminology for bootstrap samples and replicates. This is even more reason why we need everything to be clear and consistent for this course. So, before going forward discussing bootstrapping, let's get our terminology down. 
# If we have a data set with n repeated measurements, a bootstrap sample is an array of length n that was drawn from the original data with replacement.

#What is a bootstrap replicate?
#A single value of a statistic computed from a bootstrap sample.



#Part2
#Bootstrapping by hand
#To help you gain intuition about how bootstrapping works, imagine you have a data set that has only three points, [-1, 0, 1]. How many unique bootstrap samples can be drawn (e.g., [-1, 0, 1] and [1, 0, -1] are unique), and what is the maximum mean you can get from a bootstrap sample? It might be useful to jot down the samples on a piece of paper.
#(These are too few data to get meaningful results from bootstrap procedures, but this example is useful for intuition.)

#There are 27 unique samples, and the maximum mean is 1.
#Correct! There are 27 total bootstrap samples, and one of them, [1,1,1] has a mean of 1. Conversely, 7 of them have a mean of zero.
