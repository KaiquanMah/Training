# Now sample out of an exponential distribution with τ being twice as large as the optimal τ. Do it again for τ half as large. Make CDFs of these samples and overlay them with your data. You can see that they do not reproduce the data as well. Thus, the τ you computed from the mean inter-no-hitter times is optimal in that it best reproduces the data.
# Note: In this and all subsequent exercises, the random number generator is pre-seeded for you to save you some typing.



# Plot the theoretical CDFs
plt.plot(x_theor, y_theor)
plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none')
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
plt.ylabel('CDF')

# Take samples with half tau: samples_half
samples_half = np.random.exponential(tau/2, 10000)

# Take samples with double tau: samples_double
samples_double = np.random.exponential(tau*2, 10000)

# Generate CDFs from these samples
x_half, y_half = ecdf(samples_half)
x_double, y_double = ecdf(samples_double)

# Plot these CDFs as lines
_ = plt.plot(x_half, y_half)
_ = plt.plot(x_double, y_double)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

#Great work! Notice how the value of tau given by the mean matches the data best. In this way, tau is an optimal parameter.
