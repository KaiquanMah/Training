# You have modeled no-hitters using an Exponential distribution. Create an ECDF of the real data. Overlay the theoretical CDF with the ECDF from the data. This helps you to verify that the Exponential distribution describes the observed data.
#It may be helpful to remind yourself of the function you created in the previous course to compute the ECDF, as well as the code you wrote to plot it.


# Create an ECDF from real data: x, y
#Compute an ECDF from the actual time between no-hitters (nohitter_times). Use the ecdf() function you wrote in the prequel course.
x, y = ecdf(nohitter_times)

# Create a CDF from theoretical samples: x_theor, y_theor
#Create a CDF from the theoretical samples you took in the last exercise (inter_nohitter_time).
x_theor, y_theor = ecdf(inter_nohitter_time)

# Overlay the plots
#Plot x_theor and y_theor as a line using plt.plot(). Then overlay the ECDF of the real data x and y as points. To do this, you have to specify the keyword arguments marker = '.' and linestyle = 'none' in addition to x and y inside plt.plot().
plt.plot(x_theor, y_theor)
plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Margins and axis labels
#Set a 2% margin on the plot.
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
plt.ylabel('CDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


#It looks like no-hitters in the modern era of Major League Baseball are Exponentially distributed. Based on the story of the Exponential distribution, this suggests that they are a random process; when a no-hitter will happen is independent of when the last no-hitter was.
