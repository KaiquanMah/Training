# The linear regressions showed interesting information about the beak geometry. The slope was the same in 1975 and 2012, suggesting that for every millimeter gained in beak length, the birds gained about half a millimeter in depth in both years. However, if we are interested in the shape of the beak, we want to compare the ratio of beak length to beak depth. Let's make that comparison.
# Remember, the data are stored in bd_1975, bd_2012, bl_1975, and bl_2012.


# Compute length-to-depth ratios
#Make arrays of the beak length to depth ratio of each bird for 1975 and for 2012.
ratio_1975 = bl_1975 / bd_1975
ratio_2012 = bl_2012 / bd_2012

# Compute means
#Compute the mean of the length to depth ratio for 1975 and for 2012.
mean_ratio_1975 = np.mean(ratio_1975)
mean_ratio_2012 = np.mean(ratio_2012)

# Generate bootstrap replicates of the means
#Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates each for the mean ratio for 1975 and 2012 using your draw_bs_reps() function.
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(ratio_1975, np.mean, 10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(ratio_2012, np.mean, 10000)

# Compute the 99% confidence intervals
#Get a 99% bootstrap confidence interval for the length to depth ratio for 1975 and 2012.
conf_int_1975 = np.percentile(bs_replicates_1975, [0.5,99.5])
conf_int_2012 = np.percentile(bs_replicates_2012, [0.5,99.5])

# Print the results
print('1975: mean ratio =', mean_ratio_1975,
      'conf int =', conf_int_1975)
print('2012: mean ratio =', mean_ratio_2012,
      'conf int =', conf_int_2012)




# How different is the ratio?
#In the previous exercise, you computed the mean beak length to depth ratio with 99% confidence intervals for 1975 and for 2012. The results of that calculation are shown graphically in the plot accompanying this problem. In addition to these results, what would you say about the ratio of beak length to depth?

#It is impossible to say if this is a real effect or just due to noise without computing a p-value. Let me compute the p-value and get back to you.
