# The heritability of beak depth in G. scandens seems low. It could be that this observed heritability was just achieved by chance and beak depth is actually not really heritable in the species. You will test that hypothesis here. To do this, you will do a pairs permutation test.

# Initialize array of replicates: perm_replicates
#Initialize your array of replicates of heritability. We will take 10,000 pairs permutation replicates.
perm_replicates = np.empty(10000)

#Write a for loop to generate your replicates.
# Draw replicates
for i in range(10000):
    #Permute the bd_parent_scandens array using np.random.permutation().
    # Permute parent beak depths
    bd_parent_permuted = np.random.permutation(bd_parent_scandens)
    
    ##Compute the heritability between the permuted array and the bd_offspring_scandens array using the heritability() function you wrote in the last exercise. Store the result in the replicates array.
    perm_replicates[i] = heritability(bd_parent_permuted, bd_offspring_scandens)

# Compute p-value: p
#Compute the p-value as the number of replicates that are greater than the observed heritability_scandens you computed in the last exercise.
p = np.sum(perm_replicates >= heritability_scandens) / len(perm_replicates)

# Print the p-value
print('p-val =', p)


#You get a p-value of zero, which means that none of the 10,000 permutation pairs replicates you drew had a heritability high enough to match that which was observed. This strongly suggests that beak depth is heritable in G. scandens, just not as much as in G. fortis. If you like, you can plot a histogram of the heritability replicates to get a feel for how extreme of a value of heritability you might expect by chance.
