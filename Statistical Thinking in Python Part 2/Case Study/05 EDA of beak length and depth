# The beak length data are stored as bl_1975 and bl_2012, again with units of millimeters (mm). You still have the beak depth data stored in bd_1975 and bd_2012. Make scatter plots of beak depth (y-axis) versus beak length (x-axis) for the 1975 and 2012 specimens.


# Make scatter plot of 1975 data
#Make a scatter plot of the 1975 data. Use the color='blue' keyword argument. Also use an alpha=0.5 keyword argument to have transparency in case data points overlap.
_ = plt.plot(bl_1975, bd_1975, marker='.',
             linestyle='none', color='blue', alpha=0.5)

# Make scatter plot of 2012 data
#Do the same for the 2012 data, but use the color='red' keyword argument.
_ = plt.plot(bl_2012, bd_2012, marker='.',
             linestyle='none', color='red', alpha=0.5)

# Label axes and make legend
_ = plt.xlabel('beak length (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('beak depth (mm)')
_ = plt.legend(('1975', '2012'), loc='upper left')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

#In looking at the plot, we see that beaks got deeper (the red points are higher up in the y-direction), but not really longer. If anything, they got a bit shorter, since the red dots are to the left of the blue dots. So, it does not look like the beaks kept the same shape; they became shorter and deeper.
