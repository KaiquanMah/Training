# Your plot of the ECDF and determination of the confidence interval make it pretty clear that the beaks of G. scandens on Daphne Major have gotten deeper. But is it possible that this effect is just due to random chance? In other words, what is the probability that we would get the observed difference in mean beak depth if the means were the same?
# Be careful! The hypothesis we are testing is not that the beak depths come from the same distribution. For that we could use a permutation test. The hypothesis is that the means are equal. To perform this hypothesis test, we need to shift the two data sets so that they have the same mean and then use bootstrap sampling to compute the difference of means.




# Compute mean of combined data set: combined_mean
#Make a concatenated array of the 1975 and 2012 beak depths and compute and store its mean.
combined_mean = np.mean(np.concatenate((bd_1975, bd_2012)))

# Shift the samples
#Shift bd_1975 and bd_2012 such that their means are equal to the one you just computed for the combined data set.
bd_1975_shifted = bd_1975 - np.mean(bd_1975) + combined_mean
bd_2012_shifted = bd_2012 - np.mean(bd_2012) + combined_mean

# Get bootstrap replicates of shifted data sets
#Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean each for the 1975 and 2012 beak depths.
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(bd_1975_shifted, np.mean, 10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012_shifted, np.mean, 10000)

# Compute replicates of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
#Subtract the 1975 replicates from the 2012 replicates to get bootstrap replicates of the difference.
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# Compute the p-value
#Compute and print the p-value. The observed difference in means you computed in the last exercise is still in your namespace as mean_diff.
# computed difference bs_diff_replicates vs observed difference mean_diff
p = np.sum(bs_diff_replicates >= mean_diff) / len(bs_diff_replicates)

# Print p-value
print('p =', p)


#We get a p-value of 0.0034, which suggests that there is a statistically significant difference. But remember: it is very important to know how different they are! In the previous exercise, you got a difference of 0.2 mm between the means. You should combine this with the statistical significance. Changing by 0.2 mm in 37 years is substantial by evolutionary standards. If it kept changing at that rate, the beak depth would double in only 400 years.
