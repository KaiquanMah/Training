#Now, you will test the following hypothesis: On average, male bees treated with neonicotinoid insecticide have the same number of active sperm per milliliter of semen than do untreated male bees. You will use the difference of means as your test statistic.
#For your reference, the call signature for the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2 is draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1).


# Compute the difference in mean sperm count: diff_means
diff_means = np.mean(control) - np.mean(treated)

#Compute the mean of all alive sperm counts. To do this, first concatenate control and treated and take the mean of the concatenated array.
# Compute mean of pooled data: mean_count
mean_count = np.mean(np.concatenate((control, treated)))

#Generate shifted data sets for both control and treated such that the shifted data sets have the same mean.
# Generate shifted data sets
control_shifted = control - np.mean(control) + mean_count
treated_shifted = treated - np.mean(treated) + mean_count

#Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean each for the two shifted arrays. Use your draw_bs_reps() function.
# Generate bootstrap replicates
bs_reps_control = draw_bs_reps(control_shifted,
                       np.mean, size=10000)
bs_reps_treated = draw_bs_reps(treated_shifted,
                       np.mean, size=10000)

#Compute the bootstrap replicates of the difference of means.
# Get replicates of difference of means: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = bs_reps_control-bs_reps_treated

# Compute and print p-value: p
p = np.sum(bs_replicates >= np.mean(control) - np.mean(treated)) \
            / len(bs_replicates)
print('p-value =', p)

#The p-value is small, most likely less than 0.0001, since you never saw a bootstrap replicated with a difference of means at least as extreme as what was observed. In fact, when I did the calculation with 10 million replicates, I got a p-value of 2e-05.
