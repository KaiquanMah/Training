#  Another juvenile frog was studied, Frog C, and you want to see if Frog B and Frog C have similar impact forces. Unfortunately, you do not have Frog C's impact forces available, but you know they have a mean of 0.55 N. Because you don't have the original data, you cannot do a permutation test, and you cannot assess the hypothesis that the forces from Frog B and Frog C come from the same distribution. You will therefore test another, less restrictive hypothesis: The mean strike force of Frog B is equal to that of Frog C.
# To set up the bootstrap hypothesis test, you will take the mean as our test statistic. Remember, your goal is to calculate the probability of getting a mean impact force less than or equal to what was observed for Frog B if the hypothesis that the true mean of Frog B's impact forces is equal to that of Frog C is true. You first translate all of the data of Frog B such that the mean is 0.55 N. This involves adding the mean force of Frog C and subtracting the mean force of Frog B from each measurement of Frog B. This leaves other properties of Frog B's distribution, such as the variance, unchanged.


# Make an array of translated impact forces: translated_force_b
#Translate the impact forces of Frog B such that its mean is 0.55 N.
translated_force_b = force_b - np.mean(force_b) + 0.55

#Use your draw_bs_reps() function to take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean of your translated forces.
# Take bootstrap replicates of Frog B's translated impact forces: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(translated_force_b, np.mean, 10000)

# Compute fraction of replicates that are less than the observed Frog B force: p
#Compute the p-value by finding the fraction of your bootstrap replicates that are less than the observed mean impact force of Frog B. Note that the variable of interest here is force_b.
p = np.sum(bs_replicates <= np.mean(force_b)) / 10000

# Print the p-value
print('p = ', p)


# The low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis that Frog B and Frog C have the same mean impact force is false.
