# Kleinteich and Gorb (Sci. Rep., 4, 5225, 2014) performed an interesting experiment with South American horned frogs. They held a plate connected to a force transducer, along with a bait fly, in front of them. They then measured the impact force and adhesive force of the frog's tongue when it struck the target.
# Frog A is an adult and Frog B is a juvenile. The researchers measured the impact force of 20 strikes for each frog. In the next exercise, we will test the hypothesis that the two frogs have the same distribution of impact forces. But, remember, it is important to do EDA first! Let's make a bee swarm plot for the data. They are stored in a Pandas data frame, df, where column ID is the identity of the frog and column impact_force is the impact force in Newtons (N).



# Make bee swarm plot
#Use sns.swarmplot() to make a bee swarm plot of the data by specifying the x, y, and data keyword arguments.
_ = sns.swarmplot('ID','impact_force',data=df)

# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('frog')
_ = plt.ylabel('impact force (N)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
