# To help see how permutation sampling works, in this exercise you will generate permutation samples and look at them graphically.
# We will use the Sheffield Weather Station data again, this time considering the monthly rainfall in July (a dry month) and November (a wet month). We expect these might be differently distributed, so we will take permutation samples to see how their ECDFs would look if they were identically distributed.
# The data are stored in the Numpy arrays rain_june and rain_november.
# As a reminder, permutation_sample() has a function signature of permutation_sample(data_1, data_2) with a return value of permuted_data[:len(data_1)], permuted_data[len(data_1):], where permuted_data = np.random.permutation(np.concatenate((data_1, data_2))).



#Write a for loop to 50 generate permutation samples, compute their ECDFs, and plot them.
for _ in range(50):
    #Generate a permutation sample pair from rain_june and rain_november using your permutation_sample() function.
    # Generate permutation samples
    perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2 = permutation_sample(rain_june,rain_november)

    #Generate the x and y values for an ECDF for each of the two permutation samples for the ECDF using your ecdf() function.
    # Compute ECDFs
    x_1, y_1 = ecdf(perm_sample_1)
    x_2, y_2 = ecdf(perm_sample_2)

    #Plot the ECDF of the first permutation sample (x_1 and y_1) as dots. Do the same for the second permutation sample (x_2 and y_2).
    # Plot ECDFs of permutation sample
    _ = plt.plot(x_1, y_1, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='red', alpha=0.02)
    _ = plt.plot(x_2, y_2, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='blue', alpha=0.02)

#Generate x and y values for ECDFs for the rain_june and rain_november data and plot the ECDFs using respectively the keyword arguments color='red' and color='blue'.
# Create and plot ECDFs from original data
x_1, y_1 = ecdf(rain_june)
x_2, y_2 = ecdf(rain_november)
_ = plt.plot(x_1, y_1, marker='.', linestyle='none', color='red')
_ = plt.plot(x_2, y_2, marker='.', linestyle='none', color='blue')

# Label your axes, set a 2% margin, and show your plot.
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('monthly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
plt.show()

#Notice that the permutation samples ECDFs overlap and give a purple haze. None of the ECDFs from the permutation samples overlap with the observed data, suggesting that the hypothesis is not commensurate with the data. July and November rainfall are not identically distributed.
