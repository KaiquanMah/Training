# In the video, you learned that permutation sampling is a great way to simulate the hypothesis that two variables have identical probability distributions. This is often a hypothesis you want to test, so in this exercise, you will write a function to generate a permutation sample from two data sets.
# Remember, a permutation sample of two arrays having respectively n1 and n2 entries is constructed by concatenating the arrays together, scrambling the contents of the concatenated array, and then taking the first n1 entries as the permutation sample of the first array and the last n2 entries as the permutation sample of the second array.



def permutation_sample(data1, data2):
    """Generate a permutation sample from two data sets."""

    # Concatenate the data sets: data
    data = np.concatenate([data1,data2])

    # Permute the concatenated array: permuted_data
    permuted_data = np.random.permutation(data)

    # Split the permuted array into two: perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2
    perm_sample_1 = permuted_data[:len(data1)]
    perm_sample_2 = permuted_data[len(data1):]

    return perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2
