# The ability to combine multiple joins in a single query is a powerful feature of SQL, e.g:

# SELECT *
# FROM left_table
#   INNER JOIN right_table
#     ON left_table.id = right_table.id
#   INNER JOIN another_table
#     ON left_table.id = another_table.id;
# As you can see here it becomes tedious to continually write long table names in joins. This is when it becomes useful to alias each table using the first letter of its name (e.g. countries AS c)! It is standard practice to alias in this way and, if you choose to alias tables or are asked to specifically for an exercise in this course, you should follow this protocol.

# Now, for each country, you want to get the country name, its region, and the fertility rate and unemployment rate for both 2010 and 2015.
# Note that results should work throughout this course with or without table aliasing unless specified differently.



#INNER JOIN 2 tables
-- 4. Select fields
SELECT c.code, c.name, c.region, p.year, p.fertility_rate
  -- 1. From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Join with populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- 3. Match on country code
    ON c.code=p.country_code;
 
 
#INNER JOIN 3 tables
-- 6. Select fields
SELECT c.code, name, region, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
  -- 1. From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Join to populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- 3. Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
  -- 4. Join to economies (as e)
  INNER JOIN economies as e
    -- 5. Match on country code
    ON c.code=e.code;
    
     
# Scroll down the query result and take a look at the results for Albania from your previous query. Does something seem off to you?
# The trouble with doing your last join on c.code = e.code and not also including year is that e.g. the 2010 value for fertility_rate is also paired with the 2015 value for unemployment_rate.
# Fix your previous query: in your last ON clause, use AND to add an additional joining condition. In addition to joining on code in c and e, also join on year in e and p.

# Fix the INNER JOIN of 3 tables
-- 6. Select fields
SELECT c.code, name, region, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
  -- 1. From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Join to populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- 3. Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
  -- 4. Join to economies (as e)
  INNER JOIN economies AS e
    -- 5. Match on country code and year
    ON c.code=e.code AND e.year=p.year;
