# When joining tables with a common field name, e.g.

# SELECT *
# FROM countries
#   INNER JOIN economies
#     ON countries.code = economies.code
# You can use USING as a shortcut:

# SELECT *
# FROM countries
#   INNER JOIN economies
#     USING(code)
# You'll now explore how this can be done with the countries and languages tables.
