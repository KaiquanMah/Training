# Let's test your understanding of the subqueries with a challenge problem! Use a subquery to get 2015 economic data for countries that do not have
# gov_form of 'Constitutional Monarchy' or
# 'Republic' in their gov_form.

# Here, gov_form stands for the form of the government for each country. Review the different entries for gov_form in the countries table.
# Select the country code, inflation rate, and unemployment rate.
# Order by inflation rate ascending.
# Do not use table aliasing in this exercise.


-- Select fields
SELECT code, inflation_rate, unemployment_rate
  -- From economies
  FROM economies
  -- Where year is 2015 and code is not in
  WHERE year = 2015 AND code NOT IN
  	-- Subquery
  	(SELECT code
  	 FROM countries
  	 WHERE (gov_form = 'Constitutional Monarchy' OR gov_form LIKE '%epub%'))
-- Order by inflation rate
ORDER BY inflation_rate;
