# This exercise looks to explore languages potentially and most frequently spoken in the cities of Hyderabad, India and Hyderabad, Pakistan.
# You will begin with a cross join with cities AS c on the left and languages AS l on the right. Then you will modify the query using an inner join in the next tab.
# Recall that cross joins do not use ON or USING.


# CROSS JOIN
-- 4. Select fields
SELECT c.name AS city, l.name AS language 
-- 1. From cities (alias as c)
FROM cities AS c        
  -- 2. Join to languages (alias as l)
  CROSS JOIN languages AS l
-- 3. Where c.name like Hyderabad
WHERE c.name LIKE 'Hyder%';



# INNER JOIN
-- 5. Select fields
SELECT c.name AS city, l.name AS language 
-- 1. From cities (alias as c)
FROM cities AS c     
  -- 2. Join to languages (alias as l)
  INNER JOIN languages AS l
    -- 3. Match on country code
    ON c.country_code = l.code
-- 4. Where c.name like Hyderabad
WHERE c.name LIKE 'Hyder%';
