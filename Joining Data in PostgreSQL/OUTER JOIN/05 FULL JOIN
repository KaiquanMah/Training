# In this exercise, you'll examine how your results differ when using a full join versus using a left join versus using an inner join with the countries and currencies tables.
# You will focus on the North American region and also where the name of the country is missing. Dig in to see what we mean!
# Begin with a full join with countries on the left and currencies on the right. The fields of interest have been SELECTed for you throughout this exercise.
# Then complete a similar left join and conclude with an inner join.

# FULL JOIN
SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
-- 3. From countries
FROM countries
  -- 4. Join to currencies
  FULL JOIN currencies
    -- 5. Match on code
    USING (code)
-- 1. Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- 2. Order by region
ORDER BY region;



# LEFT JOIN
SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
-- 1. From countries
FROM countries
  -- 2. Join to currencies
  LEFT JOIN currencies
    -- 3. Match on code
    USING (code)
-- 4. Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- 5. Order by region
ORDER BY region;



# INNER JOIN
SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
FROM countries
  -- 1. Join to currencies
  INNER JOIN currencies
    USING (code)
-- 2. Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- 3. Order by region
ORDER BY region;
