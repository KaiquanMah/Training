# You'll now investigate a similar exercise to the last one, but this time focused on using a table with more records on the left than the right. You'll work with the languages and countries tables.

# FULL JOIN
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- 3. From languages
FROM languages
  -- 4. Join to countries
  FULL JOIN countries
    -- 5. Match on code
    USING (code)
-- 1. Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- 2. Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;



# LEFT JOIN
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
FROM languages
  -- 1. Join to countries
  LEFT JOIN countries
    -- 2. Match using code
    USING (code)
-- 3. Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
