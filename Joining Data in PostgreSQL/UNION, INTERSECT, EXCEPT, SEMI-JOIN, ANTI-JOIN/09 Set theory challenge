# Congratulations! You've now made your way to the challenge problem for this third chapter. Your task here will be to incorporate two of UNION/UNION ALL/INTERSECT/EXCEPT to solve a challenge involving three tables.
# In addition, you will use a subquery as you have in the last two exercises! This will be great practice as you hop into subqueries more in Chapter 4!

# Identify the country codes that are included in either economies or currencies but not in populations.
# Use that result to determine the names of cities in the countries that match the specification in the previous instruction.

# set theory + subquery

-- Select the city name
SELECT name
  -- Alias the table where city name resides
  FROM cities AS c1
  -- Choose only records matching the result of multiple set theory clauses
  WHERE country_code IN
(
    -- Select appropriate field from economies AS e
    SELECT e.code
    FROM economies AS e
    -- Get all additional (unique) values of the field from currencies AS c2  
    UNION
    SELECT c.code
    FROM currencies AS c
    -- Exclude those appearing in populations AS p
    EXCEPT
    SELECT p.country_code
    FROM populations AS p
);
