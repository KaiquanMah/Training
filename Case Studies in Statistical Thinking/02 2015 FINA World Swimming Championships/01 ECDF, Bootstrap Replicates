Graphical EDA of men's 200 free heats
In the heats, all contestants swim, the very fast and the very slow. To explore how the swim times are distributed, plot an ECDF of the men's 200 freestyle.



# Generate x and y values for ECDF: x, y
x, y = dcst.ecdf(mens_200_free_heats)

# Plot the ECDF as dots
_ = plt.plot(x,y,marker='.',linestyle='none')

# Label axes and show plot
plt.xlabel('time (s)')
plt.ylabel('ECDF')
plt.show()

Graphical EDA is always a great start. We see that fast swimmers are below 115 seconds, with a smattering of slow swimmers past that, including one very slow swimmer (15 seconds behind the second last swimmer).







200 m free time with confidence interval
Now, you will practice parameter estimation and computation of confidence intervals by computing the mean and median swim time for the men's 200 freestyle heats. The median is useful because it is immune to heavy tails in the distribution of swim times, such as the slow swimmers in the heats. mens_200_free_heats is still in your namespace.




# Compute mean and median swim times
mean_time = np.mean(mens_200_free_heats)
median_time = np.median(mens_200_free_heats)

# Draw 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean and median
bs_reps_mean = dcst.draw_bs_reps(mens_200_free_heats, np.mean, size=10000)
bs_reps_median = dcst.draw_bs_reps(mens_200_free_heats, np.median, size=10000)


# Compute the 95% confidence intervals
conf_int_mean = np.percentile(bs_reps_mean, [2.5,97.5])
conf_int_median = np.percentile(bs_reps_median, [2.5,97.5])

# Print the result to the screen
print("""
mean time: {0:.2f} sec.
95% conf int of mean: [{1:.2f}, {2:.2f}] sec.

median time: {3:.2f} sec.
95% conf int of median: [{4:.2f}, {5:.2f}] sec.
""".format(mean_time, *conf_int_mean, median_time, *conf_int_median))


    mean time: 111.63 sec.
    95% conf int of mean: [110.51, 112.89] sec.
    
    median time: 110.04 sec.
    95% conf int of median: [108.96, 111.01] sec.

Indeed, the mean swim time is longer than the median because of the effect of the very slow swimmers.
