EDA: Plot ECDFs of active bout length
An active bout is a stretch of time where a fish is constantly moving. Plot an ECDF of active bout length for the mutant and wild type fish for the seventh night of their lives. The data sets are in the numpy arrays bout_lengths_wt and bout_lengths_mut. The bout lengths are in units of minutes.




# Import the dc_stat_think module as dcst
import dc_stat_think as dcst

# Generate x and y values for plotting ECDFs
x_wt, y_wt = dcst.ecdf(bout_lengths_wt)
x_mut, y_mut = dcst.ecdf(bout_lengths_mut)

# Plot the ECDFs
_ = plt.plot(x_wt, y_wt, marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_mut, y_mut, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Make a legend, label axes, and show plot
_ = plt.legend(('wt', 'mut'))
_ = plt.xlabel('active bout length (min)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
plt.show()


There is an outlier of one active bout for a mutant fish, and the ECDF exposes this clearly. It is important to know about, but we will not focus on it going forward, though.










Interpreting ECDFs and the story
While a more detailed analysis of distributions is often warranted for careful analyses, you can already get a feel for the distributions and the story behind the data by eyeballing the ECDFs. Which of the following would be the most reasonable statement to make about how the active bout lengths are distributed and what kind of process might be behind exiting the active bout to rest?

If you need a refresher, here are videos from Statistical Thinking I about stories behind probability distributions.

Discrete Uniform and Binomial
Poisson processes and Poisson distribution
Normal distribution
Exponential Distribution


The bout lengths appear Exponentially distributed, which implies that exiting an active bout to rest is a Poisson process; the fish have no apparent memory about when they became active.
Yes! While not exactly Exponentially distributed, the ECDF has no left tail, and no discernible inflection point, which is very much like the Exponential CDF.
