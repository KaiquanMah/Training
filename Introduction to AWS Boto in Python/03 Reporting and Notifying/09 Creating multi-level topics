The City Council asked Sam to create a critical and extreme topic for each department.
The critical topic will trigger alerts to staff and managers.
The extreme topics will trigger alerts to politicians and directors - it means the thresholds are completely exceeded.
For example, the trash department will have a trash_critical and trash_extreme topic.
She has already created the boto3 SNS client in the sns variable. She created a variable departments that contains a unique list of departments.
In this lesson, you will help Sam make the City run faster!
You will create multi-level topics with a different set of subscribers that trigger based on different thresholds.
You will effectively be building a smart alerting system!


For each department create a critical topic and store it in critical.
For each department, create an extreme topic and store it in extreme.
Place the created TopicArns into dept_arns.
Print the dictionary.


dept_arns = {} 

for dept in departments:
  # For each deparment, create a critical topic
  critical = sns.create_topic(Name="{}_critical".format(dept))
  # For each department, create an extreme topic
  extreme = sns.create_topic(Name="{}_extreme".format(dept))
  # Place the created TopicARNs into a dictionary 
  dept_arns['{}_critical'.format(dept)] = critical['TopicArn']
  dept_arns['{}_extreme'.format(dept)] = extreme['TopicArn']

# Print the filled dictionary.
print(dept_arns)


<script.py> output:
    {'trash_critical': 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:trash_critical', 
    'trash_extreme': 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:trash_extreme', 
    'streets_critical': 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:streets_critical', 
    'streets_extreme': 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:streets_extreme', 
    'water_critical': 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:water_critical', 
    'water_extreme': 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:water_extreme'}


You just helped Sam make smart multi-level topics. Now let's get some people subscribed into them!
