The City Council were huge fans of Sam's prediction about whether scooter was blocking a sidewalk or not. So much so, they asked her to build a notification system to dispatch crews to impound scooters from sidewalks.
With the dataset she created, Sam can dispatch crews to the case's coordinates when a request has negative sentiment.
Scooter Dataframe
In this exercise, you will help Sam implement a system that dispatches crews based on sentiment and image recognition. You will help Sam pair human and machine for effective City management!
