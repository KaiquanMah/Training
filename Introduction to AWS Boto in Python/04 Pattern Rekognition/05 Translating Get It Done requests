Often, Get It Done requests come in with multiple languages in the description. This is a challenge for many City teams. In order to review the requests, many city teams need to have a translator on staff, or hope they know someone who speaks the language.
The Streets director asked Sam to help. He wanted her to translate the Get It Done requests by running a job at the end of every day.
Sam decides to run the requests through the AWS translate service. She has already loaded the CSV into the dumping_df variable and subset it to the following columns:
Get It Done requests in many languages
Help Sam translate the requests to Spanish by running them through the AWS translate service!


For each row in the DataFrame, translate it to English.
