Residents often complain that they don't know the full range of services offered through the Get It Done application.
In an effort to streamline the communication between the City government and the public, the City Council asked Sam to generate a table of all the services in the Get It Done system.
The system is dynamic and grows on a weekly basis, adding additional services. Sam didn't want to waste time updating the file manually, and felt like she can automate the process.

She loaded the DataFrame of available services into the services_df variable:
#|service_name|group|link
....


Generate an HTML table with no border and only the 'service_name' and 'link' columns.
Generate an HTML table with borders and all columns.
Make sure to set all URLs to be clickable.



# Generate an HTML table with no border and selected columns
services_df.to_html('./services_no_border.html',
           # Keep specific columns only
           columns=['service_name', 'link'],
           # Set border
           border=0)

# Generate an html table with border and all columns.
services_df.to_html('./services_border_all_columns.html', 
           border=1)
           
           
           
You just made your first HTML table from a Pandas DataFrame! Were you expecting another Dad joke here? I never make those!
