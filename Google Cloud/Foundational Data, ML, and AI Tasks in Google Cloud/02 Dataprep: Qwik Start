Click on Untitled Flow, then name and describe the flow. Since this lab uses 2016 data from the United States Federal Elections Commission 2016, name the flow "FEC-2016", and then describe the flow as "United States Federal Elections Commission 2016".
Click OK.
The FEC-2016 flow page opens.
https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data







================================



Task 4. Import datasets
In this section you import and add data to the FEC-2016 flow.

Click Add Datasets, then select the Import Datasets link.
In the left menu pane, select Cloud Storage to import datasets from Cloud Storage, then click on the pencil to edit the file path.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/IMICgtrsZL8%2BLTjmyg754ftt0I%2Bby0KSPPPdj21VCz8%3D

Type gs://spls/gsp105 in the Choose a file or folder text box, then click Go.
You may have to widen the browser window to see the Go and Cancel buttons.

Click us-fec/.
Click the + icon next to cn-2016.txt to create a dataset shown in the right pane. Click on the title in the dataset in the right pane and rename it "Candidate Master 2016".
In the same way add the itcont-2016-orig.txt dataset, and rename it "Campaign Contributions 2016".
Both datasets are listed in the right pane; click Import & Add to Flow.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/dQ3zTrEHhwVZnUJTvV3U%2Bazq5YT15qPiuq0lf38bRAw%3D

You see both datasets listed as a flow.








================================

Task 5. Prep the candidate file
By default, the Candidate Master 2016 dataset is selected. In the right pane, click Edit Recipe.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/0gU%2F3uAcWjKJtaBy%2FtOmayvgBECbTPs%2FPej3wjki9xw%3D
The Candidate Master 2016 Transformer page opens in the grid view.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9r2CStT1fxAbpxqs3CH7XWPY5OjUL5%2F63C3HL21TBNo%3D
The Transformer page is where you build your transformation recipe and see the results applied to the sample. When you are satisfied with what you see, execute the job against your dataset.



Each of the column heads have a Name and value that specify the data type. To see data types, click the column icon:
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/np%2B84KqotZFP2Vm9pfBSUhQ2QApRI3El5anSZ%2B02Rfs%3D

Notice also that when you click the name of the column, a Details panel opens on the right.
Click X in the top right of the Details panel to close the Details panel.





In the following steps you explore data in the grid view and apply transformation steps to your recipe.
Column5 provides data from 1990-2064. Widen column5 (like you would on a spreadsheet) to separate each year. Click to select the tallest bin, which represents the year 2016.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/HBgC2djaKgiuQL6XDXuhBIYIZk7ao5FbDSTac%2FmiNV8%3D
This creates a step where these values are selected.




In the Suggestions panel on the right, in the Keep rows section, click Add to add this step to your recipe.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/Ts1eNo7vDLqRv%2FjotrG8%2FK8kHycDUYORiuFK%2F5xTkp4%3D

The Recipe panel on the right now has the following step:

Keep rows where(DATE(2016, 1, 1) <= column5) && (column5 < DATE(2018, 1, 1))



In Column6 (State), hover over and click on the mismatched (red) portion of the header to select the mismatched rows.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/J4An%2BqPwdGNzAdgSvOWakFOE%2FnrgJ%2B7ijW4SGJBch38%3D

Scroll down to the bottom (highlighted in red) find the mismatched values and notice how most of these records have the value "P" in column7, and "US" in column6. The mismatch occurs because column6 is marked as a "State" column (indicated by the flag icon), but there are non-state (such as "US") values.



To correct the mismatch, click X in the top of the Suggestions panel to cancel the transformation, then click on the flag icon in Column6 and change it to a "String" column.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lZtnUvD5I6KCDVJ4Zot5dmDC1KkektpgBlQgF7OO4pc%3D

There is no longer a mismatch and the column marker is now green.




Filter on just the presidential candidates, which are those records that have the value "P" in column7. In the histogram for column7, hover over the two bins to see which is "H" and which is "P". Click the "P" bin.

Click Review, and then Add to Recipe to return to the grid view.









================================




Task 7. Summary of data
Generate a useful summary by aggregating, averaging, and counting the contributions in Column 16 and grouping the candidates by IDs, names, and party affiliation in Columns 2, 24, 8 respectively.

At the top of the Recipe panel on the right, click on New Step and enter the following formula in the Transformation search box to preview the aggregated data.
pivot value:sum(column16),average(column16),countif(column16 > 0) group: column2,column24,column8



An initial sample of the joined and aggregated data is displayed, representing a summary table of US presidential candidates and their 2016 campaign contribution metrics.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/KWn%2BlaBdq7hmCkvWKzDVVGl0JYFKCEXuKEJ2GkfF7uA%3D

Click Add to open a summary table of major US presidential candidates and their 2016 campaign contribution metrics.








================================



Task 8. Rename columns
You can make the data easier to interpret by renaming the columns.

Add each of the renaming and rounding steps individually to the recipe by clicking New Step, then enter:
rename type: manual mapping: [column24,'Candidate_Name'], [column2,'Candidate_ID'],[column8,'Party_Affiliation'], [sum_column16,'Total_Contribution_Sum'], [average_column16,'Average_Contribution_Sum'], [countif,'Number_of_Contributions']



Then click Add.
Add in this last New Step to round the Average Contribution amount:
set col: Average_Contribution_Sum value: round(Average_Contribution_Sum)



Then click Add.
Your results look something like this:
