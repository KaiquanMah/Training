Overview
Natural language is the language that humans use to communicate with each other. Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that is concerned with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP research has the goal of enabling computers to understand and process human language in a way that is similar humans.
The Cloud Natural Language API is a cloud-based service that provides natural language processing capabilities. It can be used to analyze text, identify entities, extract information, and answer questions.


Cloud Natural Language API features
Entity Recognition: Identify entities in text, such as people, places, and things.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.
Information Extraction: Extract information from text, such as dates, times, and price.
Question Answering: Answer questions about text.
Integrated REST API: Access via REST API. Text can be uploaded in the request or integrated with Cloud Storage.



What you'll do
In this lab, you learn how to:
Create an API key
Use the Cloud Natural Language API to extract "entities" (e.g. people, places, and events) from a snippet of text



gcloud auth list
gcloud config list project





======================================



Task 1. Create an API key
First, you will set an environment variable with your PROJECT_ID which you will use throughout this lab:
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value core/project)




Next, create a new service account to access the Natural Language API:
gcloud iam service-accounts create my-natlang-sa \
  --display-name "my natural language service account"



Then, create credentials to log in as your new service account. Create these credentials and save it as a JSON file "~/key.json" by using the following command:
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json \
  --iam-account my-natlang-sa@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

Finally, set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable. The environment variable should be set to the full path of the credentials JSON file you created, which you can see in the output from the previous command:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/USER/key.json"












======================================



Task 2. Make an entity analysis request
In order to perform next steps please connect to the instance provisioned for you via ssh. Open the navigation menu and select Compute Engine. You should see the following provisioned linux instance:
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/oQ7fvuCcCcR4SMgGdCuBmvLcJvnXISLbEkWLD7C2hus%3D


Click on the SSH button. You will be brought to an interactive shell. Remain in this SSH session for the rest of the lab.




Now you'll try out the Natural Language API's entity analysis with the following sentence:
Michelangelo Caravaggio, Italian painter, is known for 'The Calling of Saint Matthew'
Run the following gcloud command:
gcloud ml language analyze-entities --content="Michelangelo Caravaggio, Italian painter, is known for 'The Calling of Saint Matthew'." > result.json










======================================



Run the below command to preview the output of result.json file:
cat result.json



You should see a response similar to the following in the result.json file:

    }

}



Read through your results. For each "entity" in the response, you'll see:
The entity name and type, a person, location, event, etc.
metadata, an associated Wikipedia URL if there is one.
salience, and the indices of where this entity appeared in the text. Salience is a number in the [0,1] range that refers to the centrality of the entity to the text as a whole.
mentions, which is the same entity mentioned in different ways.
