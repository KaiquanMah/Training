Task 7. Verify your data stores and applications



In this task, you will verify that your various data stores and applications are functioning correctly by checking data imports, running test queries, and confirming access permissions. You will test unstructured, structured, website, healthcare, Google Drive, and custom embedding data stores using the AI Applications. Additionally, you will perform a second-user access test to ensure proper sharing and visibility of documents.



Check your unstructured data store
Confirm that your data has been imported successfully into rag-data-store. If you have any errors, resolve them before checking your progress.
Using the Preview pane for your rag-search application, enter a query of How do I book air travel?.
Note the results.


Check your structured data store
Confirm that your data has been imported successfully into structured-data-store. If you have any errors, resolve them before checking your progress.
Test your data store by doing a query in the Preview page of your structured-search application using the following query string: Create a list of orders that have a line item for product 6373. Each line should be formatted: order number, order date, customer name.




Check your Website data store
Confirm that your data has been imported successfully into web-data-store. If you have any errors, resolve the errors before checking your progress.
Test your data store by doing a query in the Preview page of your website-search-app application using the following query string: ImportDocumentsRequest. This should return results that document how to use this method when writing AI Applications Search custom clients.



Check your Healthcare API data store
Confirm that your data has been imported successfully into healthcare-datastore. If you have any errors, resolve them before checking your progress.

Test your data store by doing a query in the Preview page of your healthcare-search-app application using the following parameters:
Setting	Value
Patient ID	5af42e88-ebae-4e56-974d-c0246955b03f
Search text	hemoglobin








Check your Google Drive data store
Perform test queries as the primary lab user
Test your Google Drive data store by doing a couple of queries in your drive-search-app application.
Query
- Man and dog
- What was Google's revenue in the most recent earnings statement?
The answer to the second question will be based on the latest earnings statement that was uploaded to Drive.


Share a folder with the secondary lab user
Return to the tab with Google Drive open.
Open the lab_drive_files folder, and right-click the gen-app-build_search_stanford-cs-224 folder.
Select Share > Share from the context menu
Copy the Username 2 value from the left side of the instructions window and paste it into the Add people... field in the sharing modal dialog.
Deselect Notify people, and click Share. The second user should now have access to the computer science course files, but not to the investment files or images.

Log into Google Cloud with a second user account
Return to the console window (make sure not to do this in the Google Drive tab), and click on the user avatar in the upper right corner, then click Sign out.
Sign in to the Google Cloud Console using Username 2 account (student-00-10f468526ffa@qwiklabs.net) and the password shown in the lab connection details pane.

Test your application with the second account
In the tab that has your second user account logged into the console, go to AI Applications.
Open the drive-search-app application.
Go the Preview page and try these queries:
- What was Google's revenue in the most recent earnings statement?
- What are the main sources of difficulty in training recurrent models?

True or false: The second user only sees documents shared with them.
YES	True
False







Check your custom embedding data store
Confirm that your data has been imported successfully into embeddings-datastore. If you have any errors, resolve them before checking your progress.
Test your data store by doing a query in the Preview page of your embedding-search application using the following query
- do any products use Framework Atlas.

Task 8. Add data to an existing data store



In this task, you will update your RAG data store by adding new employee benefits documents while retaining existing content. Using AI Applications, you will import a new set of PDFs from a Cloud Storage folder to ensure the latest information is available for retrieval.


Consider the following scenario:
Over time, your company adds new employee benefits and perks
Management creates PDF documents explaining these new offerings
You want to update your RAG data store to include these new documents while retaining the original content



In AI Applications, go to rag-data-store and import a new set of PDFs using the following:
Setting	Value
Source	Cloud Storage
Folder to import	qwiklabs-gcp-00-3878bf15c313/new_perks
Data import options	[select the right type] - Incremental
---
Data import options

Incremental
Adds new documents and replaces existing documents with updated documents with the same ID.

Full
Adds new and updated documents and removes documents that are not in the source data. Equivalent to deleting all documents in the datastore and then importing new ones.

Task 9. Delete an application and a data store


Delete the structured data application and data store.






===================

Overall, it is disappointing that qwiklabs is not marking my completion for the 2 labs below.
This lab was also too lengthy. With qwiklab marking issues even when we have completed the tasks, it was also a frustrating lab to complete.

Task 6. Create a data store connected to Google Drive - qwiklabs is not marking my completion
Task 8. Add data to an existing data store - qwiklabs is not marking my completion
