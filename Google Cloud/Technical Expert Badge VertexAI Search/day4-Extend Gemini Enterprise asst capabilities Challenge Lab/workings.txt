Upon creation, a Gemini Enterprise assistant has the ability to search and respond to natural language queries about your content.


In this lab, you will demonstrate your ability to extend its capabilities beyond the basics. Specifically, you will enhance the Gemini Enterprise assistant with the following:
- a Gmail action to allow the assistant to write and send emails
- Grounding with Google Search to allow the assistant to base its responses on up-to-date public information found using Google Search
- the ability to refer queries to a custom Conversational Agent that has been provided a Tool to invoke a Cloud Run function



In this challenge lab, you will demonstrate your ability to:
Deploy a Gemini Enterprise app
Create an OAuth Consent Screen & Client
Enable the Gemini Enterprise Gmail action
Allow your assistant to ground its responses with Google Search
Deploy a Cloud Run function and an associated OpenAPI Tool to allow a conversational agent to be able to invoke your function
Integrate your conversational agent into your Gemini Enterprise app








======================================



Task 1. Add content to Google Drive

======================================



Task 3. Create an OAuth Consent Screen and Configure the Gmail Action

In this section, you will configure an OAuth consent screen for your Gemini Enterprise app, enabling user authorization. You will also create an OAuth client and add a Gmail action to your Gemini Enterprise app, allowing the AI assistant to generate email drafts. In order for the AI assistant to take actions on a user’s behalf, the user must grant access to your app.

In the Google Auth Platform, create an OAuth consent screen for your app. 
Name it 'Cymbal Shops Gemini Enterprise'. 
It should be intended for an Internal Audience with 
'student-00-90f04390e32d@qwiklabs.net' as User support email and Email addresses.

Create an OAuth Client of type 'web application' named 'Gemini Enterprise Client for Cymbal' with the required Gemini Enterprise authorized redirect URI.

======================================



Task 4. Create a BigQuery table to store feedback
Over the next few tasks, you will enable the Gemini Enterprise assistant to record employees' feedback on their experiences in Cymbal Shops stores.

In this task, you'll create a table to serve as the destination to store incoming feedback.

Open a Cloud Shell terminal by selecting your Cloud Console window, then typing on your keyboard the G key and then the S key.

Click the Authorize button when prompted to authorize Cloud Shell.

In your Cloud Shell terminal, paste the following to create a employee_feedback_schema.json file to define the schema for a BigQuery table which will be used to record employee feedback:
```
cat > employee_feedback_schema.json << EOF
[
  {
    "name": "feedback",
    "type": "STRING",
    "mode": "REQUIRED"
  },
  {
    "name": "store_number",
    "type": "INTEGER",
    "mode": "NULLABLE"
  }
]
EOF
```

Create the BigQuery dataset and table by running the following in Cloud Shell:
```
bq --location=US mk -d feedback
bq mk -t feedback.employee_feedback employee_feedback_schema.json
```



```
student_00_90f04390e32d@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-02-f24785f0fe3c)$ bq --location=US mk -d feedback
bq mk -t feedback.employee_feedback employee_feedback_schema.json
Dataset 'qwiklabs-gcp-02-f24785f0fe3c:feedback' successfully created.
Table 'qwiklabs-gcp-02-f24785f0fe3c:feedback.employee_feedback' successfully created.
```

Once the dataset and table have been successfully created, you can close the Cloud Shell panel by clicking the X in the upper right of the terminal panel.







======================================


Task 5. Create a Cloud Run Function to record feedback

In this task, you'll create the Cloud Run function that will take requests sent as JSON and write them to the table you created above.

Using the search bar at the top of the Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Run.

From the options at the top of the Cloud Run console, select Write a Function.

In the service creation menu, keep the Functions option selected ("Use an inline editor to create a function").

Under the Endpoint URL header, copy the provided URL and paste it in a text document. You will need to access it later.

Set the Runtime to Python 3.12.

Under the Authentication header, select Require authentication.

Keep the other settings as they are and click Create. The Source tab for the function will be loaded.

Rename the Function entry point to record_feedback.

Click the requirements.txt file on the left, delete its contents, and paste in the following:
```
functions-framework==3.*
google-cloud-bigquery
```


Click the main.py file on the left, delete its contents, and paste in the following code. This function will take the feedback details sent in JSON as a POST request and write those values to a new row in the BigQuery table you created earlier:
```
import functions_framework
from google.cloud import bigquery

@functions_framework.http
def record_feedback(request):
    """Writes employee feedback to BigQuery.
    Args:
        request (flask.Request): A request object with JSON
          containing fields for feedback and a store_number.

        JSON response containing a 'message' field indicating the
          status of the request.
    """
    request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
    request_args = request.args
    print("JSON:" + str(request_json))
    print("args:" + str(request_args))

    bq_client = bigquery.Client()
    table_id = "qwiklabs-gcp-02-f24785f0fe3c.feedback.employee_feedback"

    row_to_insert = [
        {
        "feedback": request_json["feedback"],
        "store_number": request_json.get("store_number",0)
        },
    ]

    errors = bq_client.insert_rows_json(table_id, row_to_insert)  # Make an API request.
    if errors == []:
        return {"message": "New row has been added."}
    else:
        return {"message": "Encountered errors while inserting rows: {}".format(errors)}
```





Wait till all the steps of creating the service are completed in the upper left, then click Save and redeploy.

Pause until the Deploying revision activities all show a Completed status message.

======================================


Task 6. Create a Conversational Agent Tool to call the Cloud Run Function
Now you can create a Tool in the Conversational Agent console that can call the Cloud Run function. Your conversational agent will be able to use this Tool to record the employee feedback.

Navigate to AI Applications and create a Conversational agent app.

Enable the Dialogflow API.

On the Conversational Agents page, If a project selection pop-up appears, choose your Project ID qwiklabs-gcp-02-f24785f0fe3c and then click Create agent.

On the Get started with Conversational Agents popup, select Build your own.

On the Create agent page, for the agent display name, enter 'Employee Feedback Bot'.

Set the location to 'global' and keep the Conversation start option 'Playbook' selected.

Click Create.





Settings>>
Enable Cloud Logging and Conversation History to activate logging and store conversation records for your agent. Don't forget to save your settings update.





Before working with the Playbook, create a 'Tool' named 'Record Employee Feedback' with a Type of 'OpenAPI'.

For a Description, enter 'Used to record employee feedback'.

You will create a Schema of type YAML. Paste the following into the Schema text box:
```

Click Save.







======================================


Task 7. Create a Conversational Agent Playbook
Now that the Tool is ready, you can create a conversational agent that can receive feedback in natural language and use the Tool to write them to the BigQuery table via the Cloud Run function.

In the browser tab with the Conversational Agents console, return to the Default Generative Playbook that has already been created.

Change the Playbook name to 'Receive Employee Feedback'.

For a Goal, enter:
```
Receive and record feedback about our stores identified by store number.
```

Write your own Instructions that prompt the agent to receive a store number and feedback, then use that to call its Record Employee Feedback Tool and thank the user for their feedback, letting them know it has been recorded.
student
```
- Ask the user to provide a store_number (in integer) and feedback. Assume a store_number of 0 for feedback without a store_number:
    - Use ${TOOL: Record Employee Feedback}
    - Thank the user for entering a feedback and please visit our store again!
```
Save the Playbook.



Use the Conversational Agents simulator (Conversational Agents simulator icon) to preview the conversational agent and make sure it is behaving as you would expect with the following chat input:
```
I went to store number 123. I found that everything in the bakery area was in need of a cleaning.
```

You should see a card indicating that the Record Employee Feedback Tool was used, and you can click on it to see the Tool input and response:
Record Employee Feedback Tool card indicating a successful tool call.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/bFbihYfYY1ZGbrYtXfDLDOo5gbrnEwk7BSbt0KEaXYs%3D

Your chat should end with thanking the user.

To confirm that feedback is being recorded, return to the browser tab displaying your BigQuery employee_feedback table and refresh the Preview tab to see new entries.

Update your playbook instructions and re-test until your test conversations end with a clear message indicating that a response has been recorded, and you can see new feedback recorded in your BigQuery table.







======================================


Task 8. Integrate your conversational agent with your Gemini Enterprise app
The pieces all come together now as you give your Gemini Enterprise assistant access to send messages to your conversational agent and receive its responses.

Return to Gemini Enterprise and select your Gemini Enterprise app.

Edit the app's Configurations and begin to add a new agent to your assistant.
New Agent Card
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/cZgNm%2Fnqde3Tlzy3nXBRFlUYH9yQBmIthK71NZZnQWA%3D


From the Conversational Agents console, copy the 'full resource name for your Employee Feedback Bot' agent and enter it in the New Agent card's Agent field.

For an Agent display name, use 'Employee Feedback Bot'.

For Instructions enter:
```
Record feedback when provided feedback and a store number.
```

Notice that these instructions instruct the Gemini Enterprise assistant to do the work of gathering the required information before passing the details to the conversational agent for a single turn of conversation.

Save and publish your updates.







======================================



Task 9. Communicate with your conversational agent through the Gemini Enterprise assistant
With the entire flow connected, you can see your Gemini Enterprise assistant communicate with your conversational agent, which in turn uses its Tool to record employee feedback.

To access your app from the Gemini Enterprise page, navigate to the Overview tab in the left-hand menu, click Copy URL, and open it in a new browser tab. Alternatively, you can navigate to the Integration tab and copy the URL from the 'The link to your web app section'.
https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/home/cid/afc09b1f-00bf-4afa-a3f8-c7de7bf6e5f5

Note: If you see a 404 error, you may need to give your app more time to be created. You can reload the page every few minutes until the Gemini Enterprise web app appears.






To test the assistant's ability to use your 'Gmail action', using the primary search bar, ask:
```
Send an email to my_manager@qwiklabs.net with high-level insights from the Cymbal Shops Sales Analysis Report. Offer to discuss it further.   
```

If the output does not appear as a Gmail action you can Authorize, as pictured below, send the request to the assistant again. If it still doesn't work, the action may need a little more time to become active, so try again in a few minutes.

Output:
Email
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/2HzIy6MUZ4ubjHZUld6jOBfInRS8VKlLKUZb2oAmYHE%3D



When the action dialog appears, click Authorize to open the OAuth Consent Screen you configured, and authorize it with your Qwiklabs student account.

Once the application is authorized, click Send to send the email.














To test the assistant's ability to use Grounding with Google Search, verify that the Google Search option is enabled on the primary search bar and ask:
```
