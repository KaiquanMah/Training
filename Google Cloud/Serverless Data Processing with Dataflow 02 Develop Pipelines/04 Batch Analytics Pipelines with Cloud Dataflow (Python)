On the left panel of your notebook environment, in the file browser, you will notice the training-data-analyst repo added.

Navigate into the cloned repo /training-data-analyst/quests/dataflow_python/. You will see a folder for each lab, which is further divided into a lab sub-folder with code to be completed by you, and a solution sub-folder with a fully workable example to reference if you get stuck.
Note: To open a file for editing purposes, simply navigate to the file and click on it. This will open the file, where you can add or modify code.







============================


Part 1. Aggregating site traffic by user
In this part of the lab, you write a pipeline that:

Reads the day’s traffic from a file in Cloud Storage.
Converts each event into a CommonLog object.
Sums the number of hits for each unique user by grouping each object by user ID and combining the values to get the total number of hits for that particular user.
Performs additional aggregations on each user.
Writes the resulting data to BigQuery.











============================

Task 1. Generate synthetic data
As in the prior labs, the first step is to generate data for the pipeline to process. You will open the lab environment and generate the data as before:



Open the appropriate lab
In the terminal in your IDE environment, run the following commands:
# Change directory into the lab
cd 3_Batch_Analytics/lab
export BASE_DIR=$(pwd)
Copied!





Setting up virtual environment and dependencies
Before you can begin editing the actual pipeline code, you need to ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies.

Execute the following to create a virtual environment for your work in this lab:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
Copied!
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv df-env
Copied!
source df-env/bin/activate
Copied!
Next, install the packages you will need to execute your pipeline:
python3 -m pip install -q --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install apache-beam[gcp]
Copied!
Ensure that the Dataflow API is enabled:
gcloud services enable dataflow.googleapis.com
Copied!






Set up the data environment
# Create GCS buckets and BQ dataset
cd $BASE_DIR/../..
source create_batch_sinks.sh

# Generate event dataflow
source generate_batch_events.sh

# Change to the directory containing the practice version of the code
cd $BASE_DIR
Copied!




The script creates a file called events.json containing lines resembling the following:

{"user_id": "-6434255326544341291", "ip": "192.175.49.116", "timestamp": "2019-06-19T16:06:45.118306Z", "http_request": "\"GET eucharya.html HTTP/1.0\"", "lat": 37.751, "lng": -97.822, "http_response": 200, "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.01; Trident/5.1)", "num_bytes": 182}
Copied!
It then automatically copies this file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket at Cloud Storage path.

Navigate to Google Cloud Storage and confirm that your storage bucket contains a file called events.json.












============================


Task 2. Sum page views per user
In the file explorer, navigate to training-data-analyst/quest/dataflow_python/3_Batch_Analytics/lab and open the batch_user_traffic_pipeline.py file. This pipeline already contains the necessary code to accept command-line options for the input path and the output table name, as well as code to read in events from Google Cloud Storage, parse those events, and write results to BigQuery. However, some important parts are missing.

The next step in the pipeline is to aggregate the events by each unique user_id and count page views for each. An easy way to do this on objects of type beam.Row or objects with a Beam schema is to use the GroupBy transform and then perform some aggregations on the resulting group. For example:
purchases | GroupBy('user_id', 'address')
Copied!
will return a PCollection of rows with two fields.





The first is a Row with schema representing every unique combination of 'user_id' and address (both strings), "key", and "values". The second field is an iterable of type Row containing all of the objects in the unique group from the first field.




This is most useful when you can perform aggregate calculations on this grouping and name the resulting fields, like so:
(purchases | GroupBy('user_id')
             .aggregate_field("item_id", CountCombineFn(), "num_purchases")
             .aggregate_field("cost_cents", sum, "total_spend_cents")
             .aggregate_field("cost_cents", max, "largest_purchases"))
             .with_output_types(UserPurchases)
Copied!



This returns a Row with fields corresponding to the "key(s)" we grouped by and the corresponding aggregations computed here.

The aggregate_field method takes three arguments. The first argument is a string, referring to the name of the field we wish to aggregate in the input PCollection's schema. The second is the combiner we wish to apply, implemented as a subclass of CombineFn. The third argument is a string that we use to identify the aggregation in the schema of the output PCollection.

Certain aggregation functions, such as sum and max, are implemented directly as combiners in Beam Python (Link). Count is implemented via CountCombineFn.

The output PCollection by default is a PCollection of type Row, but we can also apply our own custom types with schema using with_output_types. We see that above with UserPurchases. However, this means that we need to define a schema for type UserPurchases. We can do so easily by creating a subclass of typing.NamedTuple or via creating the schema ad hoc using beam.Row or beam.Select. We will cover the first case here. For the second please refer to the Beam programming guide.

The output of our aggregation above has four fields: user_id (type str), num_purchases, total_spend_cents, and largest_purchases (all type int).





We create a subclass of NamedTuple with these field names and types then register the coder for the schema:
class UserPurchases(typing.NamedTuple):
  user_id : str
  num_purchases : int
  total_spend_cents : int
  largest_purchases : int

beam.coders.registry.register_coder(UserPurchases, beam.coders.RowCoder)
Copied!




Note: In this example you could aggregate on any of the fields for `CountCombineFn()`, or even on the wildcard field `*`, as this transform is simply counting how many elements are in the entire group.
The next step in the pipeline is to aggregate events by user_id, sum the pageviews, and also calculate some additional aggregations on num_bytes, for example total user bytes, maximum user bytes, and minimum user bytes.

To complete this task, add another transform to the pipeline that groups the events by user_id and then performs the relevant aggregations. Keep in mind the input, the CombineFns to use, and how you name the output fields. After this, create a new output type with schema (call it PerUserAggregation) and ensure that the output Row is converted into this type. The tasks in the code are marked with # TODO.










============================



Task 3. Run your pipeline
Return to Cloud Shell and execute the following command to run your pipeline using the Cloud Dataflow service. You can run it with DirectRunner if you're having trouble, or refer to the solution.

export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
export REGION=Region
export BUCKET=gs://${PROJECT_ID}
export PIPELINE_FOLDER=${BUCKET}
export RUNNER=DataflowRunner
export INPUT_PATH=${PIPELINE_FOLDER}/events.json
export TABLE_NAME=${PROJECT_ID}:logs.user_traffic

cd $BASE_DIR
python3 batch_user_traffic_pipeline.py \
--project=${PROJECT_ID} \
--region=${REGION} \
--staging_location=${PIPELINE_FOLDER}/staging \
--temp_location=${PIPELINE_FOLDER}/temp \
--runner=${RUNNER} \
--input_path=${INPUT_PATH} \
--table_name=${TABLE_NAME}








============================



Task 4. Verify results in BigQuery
To complete this task, wait a few minutes for the pipeline to complete, then navigate to BigQuery and query the user_traffic table.








============================



Part 2. Aggregating site traffic by minute
In this part of the lab, you create a new pipeline called batch_minute_traffic. batch_minute_traffic expands on the basic batch analysis principles used in batch_user_traffic and, instead of aggregating by users across the entire batch, aggregates by when events occurred.

In the IDE, open the file batch_minute_traffic_pipeline inside 3_Batch_Analytics/lab.









============================



Task 5. Add timestamps to each element
An unbounded source provides a timestamp for each element. Depending on your unbounded source, you may need to configure how the timestamp is extracted from the raw data stream.

However, bounded sources (such as a file from TextIO, as is used in this pipeline) do not provide timestamps.

You can parse the timestamp field from each record and use the beam.window.TimestampedValue transform to attach the timestamps to each element in your PCollection.
def add_timestamp(element):
  ts = # Do Something
  return beam.window.TimestampedValue(element, ts)

unstamped = ...
stamped = unstamped | beam.Map(add_timestamp)
Copied!




To complete this task, add a transform to the pipeline that adds timestamps to each element of the pipeline. To do this, leverage the datetime package to convert the timestamp field of the element into a datetime object. You may need to explore the datetime.strptime function to do so.








============================


Task 6. Window into one-minute windows
Windowing subdivides a PCollection according to the timestamps of its individual elements. Transforms that aggregate multiple elements, such as GroupByKey and Combine, work implicitly on a per-window basis — they process each PCollection as a succession of multiple, finite windows, though the entire collection itself may be of unbounded size.

You can define different kinds of windows to divide the elements of your PCollection. Beam provides several windowing functions, including:
Fixed-time windows
Sliding-time windows
Per-session windows
Single global window
Calendar-based windows (not supported by the Beam SDK for Python, as of when this lab was written)



In this lab, you use fixed-time windows. A fixed-time window represents a non-overlapping time interval of consistent duration in the data stream. Consider windows with a five-minute duration: all of the elements in your unbounded PCollection with timestamp values from 0:00:00 up to (but not including) 0:05:00 belong to the first window, elements with timestamp values from 0:05:00 up to (but not including) 0:10:00 belong to the second window, and so on.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/qlgW3ZJ8Wq09vBlKOZ8WRg0eZ%2Fa6yHjc4nHwlFgQxOM%3D




Implement a fixed-time window with a five-minute duration as follows:
p = ...
p_windowed = p | beam.WindowInto(beam.window.FixedWindows(5*60))
Copied!


To complete this task, add a transform to your pipeline that windows elements into fixed windows one minute long.
To learn more about other types of windowing, read the Apache Beam documentation Section 8.2. Provided windowing functions.







============================




Task 7. Count events per window
Next, the pipeline needs to compute the number of events that occurred within each window. In the batch_user_traffic pipeline, a sum transform was used to sum per key. However, unlike in that pipeline, in this case the elements have been windowed and the desired computation needs to respect window boundaries.

Despite this new constraint, the Combine transform is still appropriate. That’s because Combine transforms automatically respect window boundaries.

Refer to the documentation for Count for how to add a new transform that counts the number of elements per window.

As of Beam 2.28, the best option to count elements of rows while windowing is to use beam.CombineGlobally(CountCombineFn()).without_defaults() (that is, without using full-on SQL, which we will cover more in the next lab). This transform will output a PCollection of type int which, you'll notice, is no longer using Beam schemas.

To complete this task, add a transform that counts all the elements in each window. Remember to refer to the solution if you get stuck.
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/tree/master/quests/dataflow_python/3_Batch_Analytics/solution/batch_minute_traffic_pipeline.py






============================


Task 8. Convert back to a row and add timestamp
In order to write to BigQuery, each element needs to be converted to a dict object with "page_views" as a field and additional field called "timestamp". The idea is to use the boundary of each window as one field and the combined number of pageviews as the other.

One other issue, at this point, is that the Count transform is only providing elements of type int that no longer bear any sort of timestamp information.

In fact, however, they do, though not in so obvious a way. Apache Beam runners know by default how to supply the value for a number of additional parameters, including event timestamps, windows, and pipeline options; for a full list refer to the Apache's DoFn parameters documentation.

To complete this task, write a ParDo function that accepts elements of type int, passes in the additional parameter to access window information, beam.DoFn.WindowParam, and emits dictionaries with the fields mentioned above. Note that the timestamp field in the BigQuery table schema is a STRING, so you will have to convert the timestamp to a string. The datetime.strftime function will be helpful here.
class GetTimestampFn(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element, window=beam.DoFn.WindowParam):
        window_start = #Do something!
        output = {'page_views': element, 'timestamp': window_start}
        yield output









============================



Task 9. Run the pipeline
Once you’ve finished coding, run the pipeline using the command below. Keep in mind that, while testing your code, it will be much faster to change the RUNNER environment variable to DirectRunner, which will run the pipeline locally.

export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
export REGION=Region
export BUCKET=gs://${PROJECT_ID}
export PIPELINE_FOLDER=${BUCKET}
export RUNNER=DataflowRunner
export INPUT_PATH=${PIPELINE_FOLDER}/events.json
export TABLE_NAME=${PROJECT_ID}:logs.minute_traffic

cd $BASE_DIR
python3 batch_minute_traffic_pipeline.py \
--project=${PROJECT_ID} \
--region=${REGION} \
--staging_location=${PIPELINE_FOLDER}/staging \
--temp_location=${PIPELINE_FOLDER}/temp \
--runner=${RUNNER} \
--input_path=${INPUT_PATH} \
--table_name=${TABLE_NAME}








============================


Task 10. Verify the results
To complete this task, wait a few minutes for the pipeline to execute, then navigate to BigQuery and query the minute_traffic table.
