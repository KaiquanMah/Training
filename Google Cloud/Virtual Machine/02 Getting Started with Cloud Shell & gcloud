Getting Started with Cloud Shell & gcloud
https://google.qwiklabs.com/games/1233/labs/5223



Default regions and zones are set by using the following values:
google-compute-default-zone, google-compute-default-region

To see what your default region and zone settings are, run the following gcloud command, replacing <your_project_id> which you can see on the Home page in the Console or look in the Qwiklabs tab where you started this lab, with your Project ID:
Look for the default zone and region metadata values in the response. If the google-compute-default-region and google-compute-default-zone keys and values are missing from the response, that means no default zone or region is set.
gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>
gcloud compute project-info describe --project qwiklabs-gcp-02-b1291304a9df

Initializing Cloud SDK
#on your local machine
The gcloud CLI is a part of the Cloud SDK. You need to download and install the SDK on your own system and initialize it (by running gcloud init) before you can use the gcloud command-line tool.
#on google cloud shell
The gcloud CLI is automatically available in Cloud Shell. Since you're using Cloud Shell for this lab, you don't need to install gcloud manually.






Setting environment variables
Environment variables are variables that define your environment. Define your own variables and save yourself time when writing scripts that contain APIs or executables.

Make a couple of environment variables:
export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>
export PROJECT_ID=qwiklabs-gcp-02-b1291304a9df

Set your ZONE environment variable (use the value for zone from the earlier command):
export ZONE=<your_zone>
export ZONE=us-central1-a


Verify that your variables were set properly:
echo $PROJECT_ID
echo $ZONE



#set variable value
export variableName=value
#retrieve variable value
echo $variableName






Create a virtual machine with gcloud
Create a new virtual machine instance using gcloud. In the following command you'll use:
'gcloud compute' which enables you to easily manage your Compute Engine resources in a friendlier format than using the Compute Engine API.
'instances create' creates a new instance.


Run the following to create your vm:
gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE

The name of the vm is "gcelab2",
You're using the --machine-type flag to specify the machine type as "n1-standard-2"
You're using the --zone flag to specify that it gets created in the zone you defined with your environment variable.
If you omit the --zone flag, gcloud can infer your desired zone based on your default properties. Other required instance settings, like machine type and image, if not specified in the create command, are set to default values.

(output)
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/qwiklabs-gcp-02-b1291304a9df/zones/us-central1-a/instances/gcelab2].
NAME     ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP      STATUS
gcelab2  us-central1-a  n1-standard-2               10.128.0.2   104.197.105.254  RUNNING



You can see the default values by displaying help for the create command:
gcloud compute instances create --help

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances create facilitates the creation of Compute Engine
    virtual machines.

    When an instance is in RUNNING state and the system begins to boot, the
    instance creation is considered finished, and the command returns with a
    list of new virtual machines. Note that you usually cannot log into a new
    
        instance until it finishes booting. Check the progress of an instance using
    gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to create. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
        minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a
        multiple of 1 GB. Limit boot disk size to 2 TB to account for MBR
        partition table limitations. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
                non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated
            by running gcloud projects list.

            ▸ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            ▸ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            ▸ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
                     The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.
         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.
         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.
         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use
            the first partition of the disk for its root file system. The
            default value for this is no.
         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the
            disk.
            This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.
            The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>.
            If the value is not fully qualified then kms-location, kms-keyring,
            and optionally kms-project are required.
            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.
         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
            disk.
            If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is
            being created will be used.
            If this flag is set then key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are
            required.
            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.
         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk.
            All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list

NAME
    gcloud config - view and edit Cloud SDK properties

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud config GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud config command group lets you set, view and unset properties
    used by Cloud SDK.

    A configuration is a set of properties that govern the behavior of gcloud
    and other Cloud SDK tools. The initial default configuration is set when
    gcloud init is run. You can create additional named configurations using
    gcloud init or gcloud config configurations create.

    To display the path of the active configuration along with information
    about the current gcloud environment, run $ gcloud info.

    To switch between configurations, use gcloud config configurations
    activate.

    gcloud supports several flags that have the same effect as properties in a
    configuration (for example, gcloud supports both the --project flag and
    project property). Properties differ from flags in that flags affect
    command behavior on a per-invocation basis. Properties allow you to
    maintain the same settings across command executions.

    For more information on configurations, see gcloud topic configurations.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

GROUPS
    GROUP is one of the following:

     configurations
        Manage the set of gcloud named configurations.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     get-value
        Print the value of a Cloud SDK property.

     list
        List Cloud SDK properties for the currently active configuration.

     set
        Set a Cloud SDK property.

     unset
     ......
     
     
     
     
     
     
     


gcloud Global Flags govern the behavior of commands on a per-invocation level. Flags override any values set in SDK properties.

gcloud interactive has auto prompting for commands and flags, and displays inline help snippets in the lower section as the command is typed.
Static information, like command and sub-command names, and flag names and enumerated flag values, are auto-completed using dropdown menus.
When using the interactive mode, click on the Tab key to complete file path and resource arguments. 
If a dropdown menu appears, use the Tab key to move through the list, and the Space bar to select your choice.
Enter the gcloud interactive mode:
gcloud beta interactive

(output)
Welcome to the gcloud interactive shell environment.

    Tips:

      ▪ start by typing commands to get auto-suggestions and inline help
      ▪ use tab, up-arrow, or down-arrow to navigate completion dropdowns
      ▪ use space or / to accept the highlighted dropdown item
      ▪ run gcloud <alpha|beta> interactive --help for more info

    Run $ gcloud feedback to report bugs or request new features.
    
    
    


Start typing the following command, using auto-complete to finish the command:
gcloud compute instances describe <your_vm>
gcloud compute instances describe gcelab2





Across the bottom of Cloud Shell you can see the shortcut to toggle this feature. Try out the F2 toggle:
F2:help:STATE Toggles the active help section, ON when enabled, OFF when disabled.











SSH into your vm instance
gcloud compute ssh command provides a wrapper around SSH, which takes care of authentication and the mapping of instance name to IP address.
Use gcloud compute ssh to SSH into your vm:
gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone $ZONE
