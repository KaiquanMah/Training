Getting Started with Cloud Shell & gcloud
https://google.qwiklabs.com/games/1233/labs/5223



Default regions and zones are set by using the following values:
google-compute-default-zone google-compute-default-region

To see what your default region and zone settings are, run the following gcloud command, replacing <your_project_id> which you can see on the Home page in the Console or look in the Qwiklabs tab where you started this lab, with your Project ID:
Look for the default zone and region metadata values in the response. If the google-compute-default-region and google-compute-default-zone keys and values are missing from the response, that means no default zone or region is set.
gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>



Initializing Cloud SDK
#on your local machine
The gcloud CLI is a part of the Cloud SDK. You need to download and install the SDK on your own system and initialize it (by running gcloud init) before you can use the gcloud command-line tool.
#on google cloud shell
The gcloud CLI is automatically available in Cloud Shell. Since you're using Cloud Shell for this lab, you don't need to install gcloud manually.






Setting environment variables
Environment variables are variables that define your environment. Define your own variables and save yourself time when writing scripts that contain APIs or executables.

Make a couple of environment variables:
export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>

Set your ZONE environment variable (use the value for zone from the earlier command):
export ZONE=<your_zone>

Verify that your variables were set properly:
echo $PROJECT_ID
echo $ZONE



#set variable value
export variableName=value
#retrieve variable value
echo $variableName






Create a virtual machine with gcloud
Create a new virtual machine instance using gcloud. In the following command you'll use:
'gcloud compute' which enables you to easily manage your Compute Engine resources in a friendlier format than using the Compute Engine API.
'instances create' creates a new instance.


Run the following to create your vm:
gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE

The name of the vm is "gcelab2",
You're using the --machine-type flag to specify the machine type as "n1-standard-2"
You're using the --zone flag to specify that it gets created in the zone you defined with your environment variable.
If you omit the --zone flag, gcloud can infer your desired zone based on your default properties. Other required instance settings, like machine type and image, if not specified in the create command, are set to default values.



You can see the default values by displaying help for the create command:
gcloud compute instances create --help
