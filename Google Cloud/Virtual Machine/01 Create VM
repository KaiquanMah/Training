You can list the active account name with this command:
gcloud auth list

(Output)
Credentialed accounts:
 - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)

(Example output)
Credentialed accounts:
 - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net
You can list the project ID with this command:






gcloud config list project

(Output)
[core]
project = <project_ID>

(Example output)
[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6



Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone. 
#VM and persistent disk 
To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone. 
#static IP address and persistent disk  
Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP.

#Create a new VM instance with gcloud
gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone us-central1-c

(Output)
Created [...gcelab2].
NAME     ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE  ...    STATUS
gcelab2  us-central1-c  n1-standard-2 ...    RUNNING



The instance created has these default values:
The latest Debian 9 (stretch) image.
The n1-standard-2 machine type. In this lab you can select one of these other machine types if you'd like: n1-highmem-4 or n1-highcpu-4. When you're working on a project outside of Qwiklabs, you can also specify a custom machine type.
A root persistent disk with the same name as the instance; the disk is automatically attached to the instance.

Run gcloud compute instances create --help to see all the defaults.
To exit help, press Ctrl+c.


Note: You can set the default region and zones that gcloud uses if you are always working within one region/zone and you don't want to append the --zone flag every time. Do this by running these commands :
gcloud config set compute/zone ...
gcloud config set compute/region ...



Finally, you can SSH into your instance using gcloud as well. Make sure you add your zone, or omit the --zone flag if you've set the option globally:
gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone us-central1-c
