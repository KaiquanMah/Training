Overview
The Cloud Natural Language API lets you extract entities from text, perform sentiment and syntactic analysis, and classify text into categories. In this lab, we'll focus on text classification. Using a database of 700+ categories, this API feature makes it easy to classify a large dataset of text.

What you'll learn
Creating a Natural Language API request and calling the API with curl
Using the NL API's text classification feature
Using text classification to understand a dataset of news articles



Activate Google Cloud Shell

Task 1. Confirm that the Cloud Natural Language API is enabled
Click the menu icon (Navigation menu icon) at the top left of the screen.
Select APIs & services > Enabled APIs and Services.
Click + ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES.
Then, search for "language" in the search box. Click Cloud Natural Language API.
If the API is not enabled, you'll see the ENABLE button. Click ENABLE to enable the Cloud Natural Language API.
When the API is enabled, you see the MANAGE button on the Cloud Natural Language API tile.













Task 2. Create an API key
Since you're using curl to send a request to the Natural Language API, you need to generate an API key to pass in the request URL.
To create an API key, in your Console, click Navigation menu > APIs & services > Credentials.
Then click + CREATE CREDENTIALS:
In the drop down menu, select API key:
Next, copy the key you just generated. Then click CLOSE.
Now that you have an API key, save it to an environment variable to avoid having to insert the value of your API key in each request.
In Cloud Shell run the following. Be sure to replace <your_api_key> with the key you just copied:
export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>











Task 3. Classify a news article
Using the Natural Language API's classifyText method, you can sort text data into categories with a single API call. This method returns a list of content categories that apply to a text document. These categories range in specificity, from broad categories like /Computers & Electronics to highly specific categories such as /Computers & Electronics/Programming/Java (Programming Language). A full list of 700+ possible categories can be found in the Content Categories Guide.
https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/categories
We'll start by classifying a single article, and then we'll see how we can use this method to make sense of a large news corpus. To start, let's take this headline and description from a New York Times article in the food section:
A Smoky Lobster Salad With a Tapa Twist. This spin on the Spanish pulpo a la gallega skips the octopus, but keeps the sea salt, olive oil, piment贸n and boiled potatoes.

In your Cloud Shell environment, create a request.json file with the code below. You can either create the file using one of your preferred command line editors (nano, vim, emacs) or use the Cloud Shell code editor:
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hZYBOz6ymTpCcrjxYiyPK2gVdwvdXxHVm77O5rBeFfs%3D
Create a new file named request.json and add the following:
{
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"A Smoky Lobster Salad With a Tapa Twist. This spin on the Spanish pulpo a la gallega skips the octopus, but keeps the sea salt, olive oil, piment贸n and boiled potatoes."
  }
}


student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ gedit request.json
-bash: gedit: command not found
student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ nano request.json     
{
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"A Smoky Lobster Salad With a Tapa Twist. This spin on the Spanish pulpo a la gallega skips the octopus, but keeps the sea salt, olive oil, piment贸n and boiled potatoes."
  }
}

student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ pwd
/home/student_00_e336e9eb28da
student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ ls
README-cloudshell.txt  request.json
student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ cat request.json
{
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"A Smoky Lobster Salad With a Tapa Twist. This spin on the Spanish pulpo a la gallega skips the octopus, but keeps the sea salt, olive oil, piment贸n and boiled potatoes."
  }
}







Now, you can send this text to the Natural Language API's classifyText method with the following curl command:
curl "https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:classifyText?key=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json

Look at the response:
Output:
{ categories:
  [
    {
      name: '/Food & Drink/Cooking & Recipes',
      confidence: 0.85
    },
    {
      name: '/Food & Drink/Food/Meat & Seafood',
      confidence: 0.63
    }
  ]
}

The API returned 2 categories for this text:
/Food & Drink/Cooking & Recipes
/Food & Drink/Food/Meat & Seafood
The text doesn't explicitly mention that this is a recipe or even that it includes seafood, but the API is able to categorize it. Classifying a single article is cool, but to really see the power of this feature, let's classify lots of text data.

student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ curl "https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:classifyText?key=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "/Food & Drink/Cooking & Recipes",
      "confidence": 0.85
    },
    {
      "name": "/Food & Drink/Food/Meat & Seafood",
      "confidence": 0.63
    }
  ]
}

















Task 4. Classifying a large text dataset
To see how the classifyText method can help us understand a dataset with lots of text, you'll use this public dataset of BBC news articles. The dataset consists of 2,225 articles in five topic areas (business, entertainment, politics, sports, tech) from 2004 - 2005. A subset of these articles are in a public Google Cloud Storage bucket. Each of the articles is in a .txt file.
http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html
To examine the data and send it to the Natural Language API, you'll write a Python script to read each text file from Cloud Storage, send it to the classifyText endpoint, and store the results in a BigQuery table. BigQuery is Google Cloud's big data warehouse tool - it lets you easily store and analyze large data sets.
To see the type of text you'll be working with, run the following command to view one article (gsutil provides a command line interface for Cloud Storage):
gsutil cat gs://cloud-training-demos-text/bbc_dataset/entertainment/001.txt

student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ gsutil cat gs://cloud-training-demos-text/bbc_dataset/entertainment/001.txt
Gallery unveils interactive tree
A Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London's Tate Britain art gallery.
The spruce has an antenna which can receive Bluetooth texts sent by visitors to the Tate. The messages will be "unwrapped" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree. Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002.
The plain green Norway spruce is displayed in the gallery's foyer. Its light bulb adornments are dimmed, ordinary domestic ones joined together with string. The plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the children's charity ArtWorks. Wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor Henry Moore in the late 1960s. His reputation as a sculptor grew in the 1980s, while he has been one of the most influential teachers during the last two decades. Wentworth is also known for his photography of mundane, everyday subjects such as a cigarette packet jammed under the wonky leg of a table.













Task 5. Creating a BigQuery table for our categorized text data
Before sending the text to the Natural Language API, you need a place to store the text and category for each article.
In the Google Cloud console, click Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon) > BigQuery.
Click Done for the welcome notice when launching BigQuery.
In the left panel, click the View actions icon (View action icon) next to your project name and click Create dataset.
For Dataset ID, type news_classification_dataset
Click Create dataset.
Click on the View actions icon next to your dataset name and click Create table. Use the following settings for the new table:
Create table from: Empty table
Name your table article_data
Click Add Field and add the following 3 fields: article_text with type STRING, category with type STRING, and confidence with type FLOAT.
Click CREATE TABLE.
The table is empty right now. In the next step you'll read the articles from Cloud Storage, send them to the Natural Language API for classification, and store the result in BigQuery.

















Task 6. Classifying news data and storing the result in BigQuery
Before writing a script to send the news data to the Natural Language API, you need to create a service account. This will be used to authenticate to the Natural Language API and BigQuery from a Python script.

First, back in Cloud Shell, export the name of your Cloud project as an environment variable. Replace <your_project_name> with the GCP Project ID found in the Lab details panel of the lab.
export PROJECT=<your_project_name>

<ALREADY DONE EARLIER ABOVE TASK 1 UNDER PROJECT_ID>
<DOING HERE AGAIN TO ASSIGN TO THE PROJECT VARIABLE>
student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ export PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)
Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-22237]




Then run the following commands from Cloud Shell to create a service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create my-account --display-name my-account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:my-account@$PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/bigquery.admin

Now you're ready to send the text data to the Natural Language API!
To do that, write a Python script using the Python module for Google Cloud. You can accomplish the same thing from any language, there are many different cloud client libraries.

Create a file called classify-text.py and copy the following into it. Replace YOUR_PROJECT with your GCP Project ID.
Note: Please leave the single quotes around the Project ID value in place).

from google.cloud import storage, language_v1, bigquery

# added 2022.12.28
PROJECT_ID='qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a' #'YOUR_PROJECT'

# Set up our GCS, NL, and BigQuery clients
storage_client = storage.Client()
nl_client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient()
# TODO: replace YOUR_PROJECT with your project id below

bq_client = bigquery.Client(project=PROJECT_ID)
dataset_ref = bq_client.dataset('news_classification_dataset')
dataset = bigquery.Dataset(dataset_ref)
table_ref = dataset.table('article_data') # Update this if you used a different table name
table = bq_client.get_table(table_ref)

# Send article text to the NL API's classifyText method
def classify_text(article):
        response = nl_client.classify_text(
                document=language_v1.types.Document(
                        content=article,          # the 'article' u feed to the NL API
                        type_='PLAIN_TEXT'
                )
        )
        return response

rows_for_bq = []

files = storage_client.bucket('cloud-training-demos-text').list_blobs()
print("Got article files from GCS, sending them to the NL API (this will take ~2 minutes)...")
# Send files to the NL API and save the result to send to BigQuery
for file in files:
        if file.name.endswith('txt'):
                article_text = file.download_as_bytes()
                nl_response = classify_text(article_text)
                
                # ignore articles where the NL API does not respond with/return a category label
                if len(nl_response.categories) > 0:
                        # within the 'rows_for_bq' list
                        # append a tuple of <article txt>, <most confident category>, <confidence lv>
                        rows_for_bq.append((str(article_text), str(nl_response.categories[0].name), nl_response.categories[0].confidence))

print("Writing NL API article data to BigQuery...")
# Write article text + category data to BQ
# BQ recognises each element in the tuple
# corresponds to a cell in the BQ table for each row/record
# if there are any errors, BQ returns a non-empty list
# otherwise, BQ returns an empty list
errors = bq_client.insert_rows(table, rows_for_bq)
assert errors == []

Now you're ready to start classifying articles and importing them to BigQuery.
Run the following script:
python3 classify-text.py

The script takes about two minutes to complete, so while it's running let's discuss what's happening.
Note: If you get an error while executing python3 classify-text.py, the cloud shell might be disconnected. In order to fix that, please export your environment variables by running the below commands then re-run the python3 classify-text.py command.
export PROJECT= (GCP PROJECT ID)
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=key.json

We're using the google-cloud Python client library to access Cloud Storage, the Natural Language API, and BigQuery. First, a client is created for each service; then references are created to the BigQuery table. files is a reference to each of the BBC dataset files in the public bucket. We iterate through these files, download the articles as strings, and send each one to the Natural Language API in our classify_text function. For all articles where the Natural Language API returns a category, the article and its category data are saved to a rows_for_bq list. When classifying each article is done, the data is inserted into BigQuery using insert_rows().
https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/
Note: The Natural Language API can return more than one category for a document, but for this lab you're only storing the first category returned to keep things simple.

student_00_e336e9eb28da@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-a9b1ef0c230a)$ python classify-text.py
Got article files from GCS, sending them to the NL API (this will take ~2 minutes)...
Writing NL API article data to BigQuery...






When the script has finished running, it's time to verify that the article data was saved to BigQuery.
In BigQuery, navigate to the article_data table in the BigQuery tab and click QUERY > In new tab:
article_data table
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/OhcicWXBUVe40O6i0%2BvBSs8LSbcQParRCTT74mIp%2FA8%3D

Edit the results in the Unsaved query box, adding an asterisk between SELECT and FROM:
SELECT * FROM `news_classification_dataset.article_data`

Now click RUN.
You will see your data when the query completes. Scroll to the right to see the category column.
The category column has the name of the first category the Natural Language API returned for the article, and confidence is a value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the API is that it categorized the article correctly. You'll learn how to perform more complex queries on the data in the next step.

BMW said that it was too early to say how many cars were affected or how much the recall would cost. The German company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty Bosch part. The Dingolfing site will now be closed all next week instead of for just two days. The additional three-day stoppage will mean a production loss of up to 3,600 vehicles, BMW said, adding that it was confident it could make up the numbers later.\\n\\nBosch has stopped production of the part but expects to restart by 2 February. The faulty component does not represent a safety risk but causes the motor to stall after a significant amount of mileage. When asked if BMW would be seeking compensation from Bosch, the carmaker\\\u0027s chief executive Helmut Panke said: \"we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay\". Audi and Mercedes Benz were also supplied with the defective diesel fuel-injection pumps but neither of them have to recall any vehicles. A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent company of Mercedes Benz, said it will however have to halt some production. It is to close the Mercedes factory in Sindelfingen on Monday and Tuesday. Audi said it had been hit by production bottlenecks, due to a shortage of unaffected Bosch parts.\\n\u0027",

But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. Sonia O\u0027Sullivan\u0027s Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn\u0027t have been surprised. At the start of the year, an O\u0027Sullivan had been earmarked as Ireland\u0027s best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO. Lombard\u0027s shattering of Mark Carroll\u0027s national 10,000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation. The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.\\n\\nBack at pre-Olympic ranch in Greece, it must have seemed that things couldn\u0027t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg\u0027s performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. Our beloved Sonia scraped into the women\u0027s 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it\u0027s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens. At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.\\n\\nJames McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens. 800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKee\u0027s Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came. As the summer ended, stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on 18 December. A large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andy\u0027s many friends. As only death can, it put the year\u0027s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.\\n\"",

His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet\\\u0027s Manon last week.\\n\\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich\\\u0027s Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet\\\u0027s Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi\\\u0027s La Traviata and Richard Strauss\\\u0027s Ariadne auf Naxos.\\n\\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet\\\u0027s Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti\\\u0027s debut at the New York\\\u0027s Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini\\\u0027s Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy\\\u0027s La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti\\\u0027s last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini\\\u0027s Norma at the Vienna State Opera.\\n\u0027",

Yukos\\\u0027 owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft\\\u0027s purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. \"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,\" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case. Menatep Group\\\u0027s managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: \"If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.\"\\n\\nRosneft officials were unavailable for comment. But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.\\n\u0027",

On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.\\n\\nThe government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. \"I maintain the view that Japan\\\u0027s economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. \"It\\\u0027s painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,\" said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.\\n\u0027",

Good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production. Nevertheless, 2.2 million Ethiopians will still need emergency assistance.\\n\\nThe report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for \"targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women\" will be needed.\\n\\nIn eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells. Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally. \"Local purchase of cereals for food assistance programmes is recommended as far as possible, so as to assist domestic markets and farmers,\" said Henri Josserand, chief of FAO\\\u0027s Global Information and Early Warning System. Agriculture is the main economic activity in Ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product. About 80% of Ethiopians depend directly or indirectly on agriculture.\\n\u0027",

The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot\u0027s diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.\\n\\nIn January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; \\xc2\\xa32.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi\u0027s newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm\u0027s troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.\\n\"",

Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson\\\u0027s Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n\\nSome broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n\\nThe Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black\\\u0027s Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\\n\\nTelegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.\\n\\n\"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\" he said. \"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp\\\u0027s News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail \u0026 General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.\\n\u0027",

  "article_text": "b\u0027Air passengers win new EU rights\\n\\nAir passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.\\n\\nNew EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (\\xc2\\xa3173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.\\n\\nHowever, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.\\n\\nThe EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to \\\u0027bumping\\\u0027 - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger\\\u0027s will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.\\n\\nHowever, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". Airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"It\\\u0027s a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4\\\u0027s Today programme.\\n\\nThe European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.\\n\\nEC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA\\\u0027s Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"We reckon it\\\u0027s going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that\\\u0027s over \\xc2\\xa31bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That\\\u0027s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers\\\u0027 right.\" \"This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people\\\u0027s daily lives,\" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.\\n\u0027",

The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n\\nMr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.\\n\\nYugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (\\xc2\\xa314.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.\\n\\nTexas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\\n\\nIn her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\". But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. The US court\\\u0027s jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Analysts said the ability of Gazprom and Rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of Yugansk remained unclear.\\n\\nYukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. However, it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues. \"We believe the merits of our case are strong and simple,\" said chief executive Steven Theede. \"Our assets were illegally seized. We want them back or damages paid.\"\\n\u0027",

  "article_text": "b\"Safety alert as GM recalls cars\\n\\nThe world\u0027s biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators.\\n\\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\\n\\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world\u0027s biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.\\n\"",

The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $1.32 to $44.45.\\n\\nThe Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier. \"I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,\" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital.\\n\u0027",

US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.\\n\\nForecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD\\\u0027s chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.\\n\\nA dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC\\\u0027s World Business Report. \"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\" China\\\u0027s booming economy and a \"spectacular comeback\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\" it added. However, the report warned: \"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone\\\u0027s over-reliance on export-led growth.\\n\u0027",

The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters. The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession.\\n\\nA previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.\\n\\nFigures released by the government\\\u0027s Cabinet Office showed that GDP, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,\" Mr Takenaka stressed.\\n\\nMinisters pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan\\\u0027s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. Japan\\\u0027s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. However, the economy\\\u0027s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn\\\u0027t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company\\\u0027s refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production. A spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. \"This market simply wants to go up,\" Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency. Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: \"Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast.\"\\n\\nElsewhere, a refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on Tuesday production at BP\\\u0027s Texas City refinery was taken down for a short time. In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. The rise in prices came despite a US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec\\\u0027s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. Instability in Iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.\\n\u0027",

Ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further. The carrier reported a drop in quarterly profit earlier this year after it was hit by higher fuel costs. However, when it reported the results, the airline was upbeat about prospects for 2005, despite tough competition in the budget airline market.\\n\\nRyanair chairman David Bonderman said that the 737-800 had \"significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years\".\\n\\n\"With this new order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years,\" he added. At the end of this year, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new planes, while the 70 new orders are due for delivery between 2008 and 2012. The airline said that when all these planes have been delivered, it will be able to carry more than 70 million passengers a year, making it Europe\\\u0027s largest airline.

The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday\\\u0027s announcement, BMW had invested some \\xc2\\xa3280m in Mini production.\\n\\nSince its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\\n\\nLast year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they\\\u0027ve invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\\n\\nThe price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than \\xc2\\xa310,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost \\xc2\\xa311,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to \\xc2\\xa317,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to \\xc2\\xa315,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least \\xc2\\xa38,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from \\xc2\\xa312,556, according to the-car buying website Parker\\\u0027s. The consumers\\\u0027 association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\\n\\nThe Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\\n\\nThere are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW\\\u0027s Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for \\xc2\\xa310 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory\\\u0027s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.\\n\u0027",

Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said. Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat\u0027s car business is making a loss.\\n\\nUnder the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing, distribution and research \u0026 development costs. Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.\\n\\nFiat, Italy\u0027s largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes. Fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with General Motors. The US firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright. Analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which Fiat now had to develop the business.\\n\"",

Lufthansa accounts for six out of every 10 planes using Frankfurt\\\u0027s airport.\\n\\n\"We are doing research into the possibilities we have,\" Michael Lamberty, a Lufthansa spokesman told the BBC. \"We are checking if there is action to be taken and in which courts it could be taken.\" Mr Lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue Germany\\\u0027s air traffic controllers\\\u0027 organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the German federal agencies that gave the orders. The company said that it had to cancel 77 short and medium-distance flights, affecting about 5,000 passengers. Long-haul travellers were not disrupted.\\n\\nCentral to the problem was that instead of half an hour, the arrival of President Bush on the German leg of his European tour took the best part of an hour, Lufthansa said. During that time, restrictions were put on planes taxiing, taking off and landing at Frankfurt\\\u0027s Rhein-Main airport. The extra time taken by President Bush and his entourage meant that there was a knock-on effect that led to significant delays. Mr Lamberty said that 92 outgoing flights and 86 income flights were delayed by an average of an hour following President Bush\\\u0027s arrival, affecting almost 17,000 passengers.

As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\\n\\nThe FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries\\\u0027 access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\\n\\nAccording to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (\\xc2\\xa3158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product.

Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\\n\\nAnalysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world\\\u0027s airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\\n\\nIt is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing\\\u0027s twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\\n\\n\"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\\n\\nFor Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing\\\u0027s 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International\\\u0027s Mr Learmount.\\n\\nBoth Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company\\\u0027s profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract.

The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China\\\u0027s CNPC.\\n\\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk\\\u0027s former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\\n\\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\\n\\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country\\\u0027s richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\\n\\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China\\\u0027s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China\\\u0027s thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it\\\u0027s a good deal for them too.\"\\n\u0027",

Last April, Argentina signed a $240m agreement to import Venezuelan fuel in exchange for agricultural goods and this deal has now been extended. Venezuela will now import cattle, medicines and medical equipment. Last year, Argentina\u0027s severe energy crisis forced President Kirchner to suspend gas exports to Chile. Argentina fears that rising demand could spark another crisis and wants to prevent it by signing this deal. The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina\u0027s Enarsa. Under this deal, the Argentine market will be opened to Venezuelan investment. President Chavez added that Brazil\u0027s Petrobras could join soon the co-operation deal. President Chavez is an ardent promoter of the concept of a South American oil company, which could include the state-owned companies of Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia. The two presidents also agreed to create \u0027Television Sur\u0027, a Latin American network of state-owned television channels.\\n\"",

Yukos argued that since it had a US subsidiary and local bank accounts, the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk. But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank\\\u0027s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in Houston. Its lawyer, Hugh Ray, told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary. By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts. But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 December, and then backdated.\\n\\nYukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point. He said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork, but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 December. Even so, he told the court that only $480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz, as the Yukos unit is formally known. The sale went ahead, despite an order from the US bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. In the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm Rosneft. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia\\\u0027s very profitable oil business back under state control.\\n\\nYukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia. It also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. \"It gives us a kind of life after death alternative,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. Yukos is currently suing four companies - Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, Rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in Yugansk\\\u0027s disposal. It has also threatened to sue the Russian government for $28bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos\\\u0027 legal wrangling as meaningless. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russia\\\u0027s richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.\\n\u0027",

The BBA believes that the property market is continuing to cool down.

However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.\\n\\nThe rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance.

Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. \"Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,\" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.\\n\\nAt 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank\\\u0027s 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country\\\u0027s current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn.

The Fed did not rule out raising rates once again in December but noted that any future increases would take place at a \"measured\" pace.

The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy.

A number of celebrities turned out for the musical\u0027s premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\\n\\nThe show\u0027s director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney\u0027s 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.\\n\"",

It claims this was later covered up by the Church. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, described the novel as a \"great thriller\" but \"lousy history\". The book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. Despite enjoying Dan Brown\\\u0027s conspiracy theory, the Bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.\\n\\nWriting his Christmas message in the Northern Echo, the Bishop said: \"Conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. \"Dan Brown is the best writer I\\\u0027ve come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable.\" A great deal of credible evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus\\\u0027 life was true, according to the Bishop. \"The evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity is astonishingly good,\" he said. \"We have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the New Testament than we have for the main classical authors like Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus.\\n\\n\"Historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don\\\u0027t fit the world of later legend.\" Brown\\\u0027s book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. The Da Vinci Code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims. The book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring Tom Hanks.\\n\u0027",

Waterstone\\\u0027s fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: \"It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category.

  "article_text": "b\u0027Arthur Hailey: King of the bestsellers\\n\\nNovelist Arthur Hailey, who has died at the age of 84, was known for his bestselling page-turners exploring the inner workings of various industries, from the hotels to high finance.\\n\\nBorn in Luton, Bedfordshire, on 5 April 1920, Hailey was the only child of working class parents, They could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of 14. He served as a pilot with the Royal Air Force during World War II, flying fighter planes to the Middle East. It was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut, the television screenplay Flight into Danger. Hailey emigrated to Canada in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. He wanted to be a writer from an early age, but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties, when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to Toronto.\\n\\n\"I fell to daydreaming. I visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. Could I fly the airplane? I was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn\\\u0027t flown for nine years... \" Hailey later recalled. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought Flight into Danger for $600 (\\xc2\\xa3318) and it was shown on TV in April 1956. It was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy Airplane!, starring Leslie Nielsen. Hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years, before turning to novels. He went on to produce 11 best-selling books, which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. Flight into Danger was adapted to become Hailey\\\u0027s first novel, Runaway Zero-Eight in 1958. The Final Diagnosis and In High Places followed, both achieving a popular following. But it was not until Hotel, in 1965, that Hollywood came calling. The hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. It was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s, starring James Brolin. Airport (1968) arguably remains Hailey\\\u0027s best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. The thriller follows events in the sky, and on the ground at a snow-logged airport, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb.\\n\\nThe book was adapted into a hit film in 1970, starring Burt Lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and Dean Martin as a womanising pilot, alongside Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset. In a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. The writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred, drawing his characters \"from real life\" and taking up to three years to produce each book. \"I have never been able to write quickly or easily. I am too self-critical for that. I am never satisfied,\" he once said. In 1969, he moved to Nassau in the Bahamas, with his wife Sheila. Wheels (1971), The Moneychangers (1975) and Overload (1979) followed. Despite a lukewarm response from critics, and few literary accolades, Hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. Strong Medicine, Hailey\\\u0027s blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, was turned into a film in 1986, starring Sam Neill, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a panoply of former soap stars. The 1997 novel Detective proved to be Hailey\\\u0027s final book, when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. Hailey\\\u0027s health began to deteriorate in recent years, twice undergoing heart surgery. He suffered a stroke just two months ago. He died in his sleep on Wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in New Providence island. \"He had a wonderful life. His greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that,\" said his wife, Sheila.\\n\u0027",
