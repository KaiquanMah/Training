create virtual machines (VMs) and connect to them. 
You will also create connections between the instances.


In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
Connect between the two instances.











Task 1: Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console
gcp project id        qwiklabs-gcp-02-f8bf93eb69fe
region                us-central1
zone                  us-central1-a






Task 2: Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console
In the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
Click Create.
On the Create an Instance page, for Name, type my-vm-1
For Region and Zone, select the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
For Machine type, accept the default.
For Boot disk, if the Image shown is not Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch), click Change and select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).
Leave the defaults for Identity and API access unmodified.
For Firewall, click Allow HTTP traffic.
Leave all other defaults unmodified.
To create and launch the VM, click Create.
Note: The VM can take about two minutes to launch and be fully available for use.


















Task 3: Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.
Click Continue.

To display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you, enter this partial command gcloud compute zones list | grep followed by the region that Qwiklabs or your instructor assigned you to.
Your completed command will look like this:
gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

us-central1-c              us-central1              UP
us-central1-a              us-central1              UP
us-central1-f              us-central1              UP
us-central1-b              us-central1              UP




Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned you. 
For example, if Qwiklabs assigned you to region us-central1 and zone us-central1-a you might choose zone us-central1-b.


To set your default zone to the one you just chose, enter this partial command gcloud config set compute/zone followed by the zone you chose.
Your completed command will look like this:
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

Updated property [compute/zone].



To create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone, execute this command:
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

Note: The VM can take about two minutes to launch and be fully available for use.

my-vm-2  us-central1-b  n1-standard-1               10.128.0.3   34.66.174.226  RUNNING



To close the Cloud Shell, execute the following command:
exit






















Task 4: Connect between VM instances
In the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
You will see the two VM instances you created, each in a different zone.
Notice that the Internal IP addresses of these two instances share the first three bytes in common. 
They reside on the same subnet in their Google Cloud VPC even though they are in different zones.

Name	    Zone	          Recommendation	  In use by	      Internal IP	          External IP	            Connect	
my-vm-1	  us-central1-a	                                    10.128.0.2 (nic0)	    34.70.112.247 	 	      SSH
my-vm-2	  us-central1-b	                                    10.128.0.3 (nic0) 	  34.66.174.226	 	        SSH


To open a command prompt on the my-vm-2 instance, click SSH in its row in the VM instances list.
Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
ping my-vm-1

Notice that the output of the ping command reveals that the complete hostname of my-vm-1 is my-vm-1.c.PROJECT_ID.internal, where PROJECT_ID is the name of your Google Cloud Platform project. GCP automatically supplies Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution for the internal IP addresses of VM instances.
Press Ctrl+C to abort the ping command.

In the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab. You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
If you forgot to click Allow HTTP traffic when you created the my-vm-1 VM instance, your attempt to reach your web server's home page will fail. You can add a firewall rule to allow inbound traffic to your instances, although this topic is out of scope for this course.
