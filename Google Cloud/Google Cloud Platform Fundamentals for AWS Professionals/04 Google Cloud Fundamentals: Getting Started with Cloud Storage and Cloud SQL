In this lab, you create a Cloud Storage bucket and place an image in it. 
You'll also configure an application running in Compute Engine to use a database managed by Cloud SQL. 
For this lab, you will configure a web server with PHP, a web development environment that is the basis for popular blogging software. 
Outside this lab, you will use analogous techniques to configure these packages.
You also configure the web server to reference the image in the Cloud Storage bucket.


In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
Create a Cloud Storage bucket and place an image into it.
Create a Cloud SQL instance and configure it.
Connect to the Cloud SQL instance from a web server.
Use the image in the Cloud Storage bucket on a web page.

gcp project id/name     qwiklabs-gcp-03-914ddf7d3789
region                  us-central1
zone                    us-central1-a













Task 2: Deploy a web server VM instance
In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
Click Create.
On the Create an Instance page, for Name, type bloghost
For Region and Zone, select the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
For Machine type, accept the default.
For Boot disk, if the Image shown is not Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch), click Change and select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).
Leave the defaults for Identity and API access unmodified.
For Firewall, click Allow HTTP traffic.
Click Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy to open that section of the dialog.


Enter the following script as the value for Startup script:
apt-get update
apt-get install apache2 php php-mysql -y
service apache2 restart

Be sure to supply that script as the value of the Startup script field. 
If you accidentally put it into another field, it won't be executed when the VM instance starts.


Leave the remaining settings as their defaults, and click Create.
Instance can take about two minutes to launch and be fully available for use.
On the VM instances page, copy the bloghost VM instance's internal and external IP addresses to a text editor for use later in this lab.


Name	      Zone	            Recommendation	    In use by	    Internal IP	        External IP	       Connect	
bloghost	  us-central1-a	                                    10.128.0.2 (nic0)	  34.122.254.69 	 	






















Task 3: Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the gsutil command line
All Cloud Storage bucket names must be globally unique. 
To ensure that your bucket name is unique, these instructions will guide you to give your bucket the same name as your Cloud Platform project ID, which is also globally unique.
Cloud Storage buckets can be associated with either a region or a multi-region location: US, EU, or ASIA. In this activity, you associate your bucket with the multi-region closest to the region and zone that Qwiklabs or your instructor assigned you to.


On the Google Cloud Platform menu, click Activate Cloud Shell Activate Cloud Shell. If a dialog box appears, click Start Cloud Shell.

For convenience, enter your chosen location into an environment variable called LOCATION. Enter one of these commands:
export LOCATION=US
Or
export LOCATION=EU
Or
export LOCATION=ASIA


In Cloud Shell, the DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID environment variable contains your project ID. Enter this command to make a bucket named after your project ID:
gsutil mb -l $LOCATION gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
CommandException: "mb" command does not support provider-only URLs.

student_03_53d48e8de8b9@cloudshell:~$ gsutil mb -l $LOCATION gs://$qwiklabs-gcp-03-914ddf7d3789

Updated ACL on gs://qwiklabs-gcp-03-914ddf7d3789/my-excellent-blog.png






















Task 4: Create the Cloud SQL instance
In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click SQL.
Click Create instance.
For Choose a database engine, select MySQL.

For Instance ID, type blog-db, and for Root password type a password of your choice.
Choose a password that you remember. There's no need to obscure the password because you'll use mechanisms to connect that aren't open access to everyone.

Set the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
This is the same region and zone into which you launched the bloghost instance. The best performance is achieved by placing the client and the database close to each other.

Click Create.
Wait for the instance to finish deploying. It will take a few minutes.

Click on the name of the instance, blog-db, to open its details page.
From the SQL instances details page, copy the Public IP address for your SQL instance to a text editor for use later in this lab.

Click Done to finish defining the authorized network.
Click Save to save the configuration change.























Task 5: Configure an application in a Compute Engine instance to use Cloud SQL
On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
In the VM instances list, click SSH in the row for your VM instance bloghost.


In your ssh session on bloghost, change your working directory to the document root of the web server:
cd /var/www/html

student-03-53d48e8de8b9@bloghost:~$ pwd
/home/student-03-53d48e8de8b9
student-03-53d48e8de8b9@bloghost:~$ cd /var/www/html
student-03-53d48e8de8b9@bloghost:/var/www/html$ pwd
/var/www/html






Use the nano text editor to edit a file called index.php:
sudo nano index.php


Paste the content below into the file:
<html>
<head><title>Welcome to my excellent blog</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to my excellent blog</h1>
<?php
 $dbserver = "CLOUDSQLIP";
$dbuser = "blogdbuser";
$dbpassword = "DBPASSWORD";
// In a production blog, we would not store the MySQL
// password in the document root. Instead, we would store it in a
// configuration file elsewhere on the web server VM instance.

$conn = new mysqli($dbserver, $dbuser, $dbpassword);

if (mysqli_connect_error()) {
        echo ("Database connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
} else {
        echo ("Database connection succeeded.");
}
?>
</body></html>


In a later step, you will insert your Cloud SQL instance's IP address and your database password into this file. For now, leave the file unmodified.
Press Ctrl+O, and then press Enter to save your edited file.
Press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.


Restart the web server:
sudo service apache2 restart

Open a new web browser tab and paste into the address bar your bloghost VM instance's external IP address followed by /index.php. The URL will look like this:
35.192.208.2/index.php
Be sure to use the external IP address of your VM instance followed by /index.php. 
Do not use the VM instance's internal IP address. 
Do not use the sample IP address shown above.
34.122.254.69/index.php




When you load the page, you will see that its content includes an error message beginning with the words:
Database connection failed: ...
This message occurs because you have not yet configured PHP's connection to your Cloud SQL instance.

Welcome to my excellent blog
Database connection failed: php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known









Return to your ssh session on bloghost. Use the nano text editor to edit index.php again.
sudo nano index.php

In the nano text editor, replace CLOUDSQLIP with the Cloud SQL instance Public IP address that you noted above. Leave the quotation marks around the value in place.
In the nano text editor, replace DBPASSWORD with the Cloud SQL database password that you defined above. Leave the quotation marks around the value in place.


<html>
<head><title>Welcome to my excellent blog</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to my excellent blog</h1>
<?php
 $dbserver = "35.193.86.122";
$dbuser = "blogdbuser";
$dbpassword = "blogdbuser";
// In a production blog, we would not store the MySQL
// password in the document root. Instead, we would store it in a
// configuration file elsewhere on the web server VM instance.

$conn = new mysqli($dbserver, $dbuser, $dbpassword);

if (mysqli_connect_error()) {
        echo ("Database connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
} else {
        echo ("Database connection succeeded.");
}
?>
</body></html>



Press Ctrl+O, and then press Enter to save your edited file.
Press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.


Restart the web server:
sudo service apache2 restart



Return to the web browser tab in which you opened your bloghost VM instance's external IP address. When you load the page, the following message appears:
Database connection succeeded.
In an actual blog, the database connection status would not be visible to blog visitors. Instead, the database connection would be managed solely by the administrator.



Welcome to my excellent blog
Database connection succeeded.



























Task 6: Configure an application in a Compute Engine instance to use a Cloud Storage object
In the GCP Console, click Storage > Browser.
Click on the bucket that is named after your GCP project.
In this bucket, there is an object called my-excellent-blog.png. Copy the URL behind the link icon that appears in that object's Public access column, or behind the words "Public link" if shown.
If you see neither a link icon nor a "Public link", try refreshing the browser. If you still do not see a link icon, return to Cloud Shell and confirm that your attempt to change the object's Access Control list with the gsutil acl ch command was successful.
