02 Streaming Data Processing - Streaming Data Pipelines
In this lab, you will use Dataflow to collect traffic events from simulated traffic sensor data made available through Google Cloud PubSub, process them into an actionable average, and store the raw data in BigQuery for later analysis. You will learn how to start a Dataflow pipeline, monitor it, and, lastly, optimize it.
Note: At the time of this writing, streaming pipelines are not available in the DataFlow Python SDK. So the streaming labs are written in Java.


Objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:
Launch Dataflow and run a Dataflow job
Understand how data elements flow through the transformations of a Dataflow pipeline
Connect Dataflow to Pub/Sub and BigQuery
Observe and understand how Dataflow autoscaling adjusts compute resources to process input data optimally
Learn where to find logging information created by Dataflow
Explore metrics and create alerts and dashboards with Cloud Monitoring







Check project permissions
Before you begin your work on Google Cloud, you need to ensure that your project has the correct permissions within Identity and Access Management (IAM).
In the Google Cloud console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), select IAM & Admin > IAM.
Confirm that the default compute Service Account {project-number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com is present and has the editor role assigned. The account prefix is the project number, which you can find on Navigation menu > Home.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/SMuu68pzAXGA%2F%2FgiwoeYr02rez30D0rBU8FvkNAciFM%3D

Note: If the account is not present in IAM or does not have the `editor` role, follow the steps below to assign the required role.
In the Google Cloud console, on the Navigation menu, click Home.
Copy the project number (e.g. 729328892908).
On the Navigation menu, select IAM & Admin > IAM.
At the top of the IAM page, click Add.
For New principals, type:
  {project-number}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Replace {project-number} with your project number.
For Role, select Project (or Basic) > Editor.
Click Save.














Task 1. Preparation
You will be running a sensor simulator from the training VM. In Lab 1 you manually setup the Pub/Sub components. In this lab several of those processes are automated.

Open the SSH terminal and connect to the training VM
In the Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Compute engine > VM instances.
Locate the line with the instance called training-vm.
On the far right, under Connect, click on SSH to open a terminal window.
In this lab, you will enter CLI commands on the training-vm.

Verify initialization is complete
The training-vm is installing some software in the background.
Verify that setup is complete by checking the contents of the new directory:
ls /training

The setup is complete when the result of your list (ls) command output appears as in the image below. If the full listing does not appear, wait a few minutes and try again.
Note: It may take 2 to 3 minutes for all background actions to complete.


Download code repository
Next you will download a code repository for use in this lab:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst


Set environment variables
On the training-vm SSH terminal enter the following:
source /training/project_env.sh

This script sets the DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID and BUCKET environment variables.






















Task 2. Create a BigQuery dataset and Cloud Storage bucket
The Dataflow pipeline will be created later and written into a table in the BigQuery dataset.

Open BigQuery Console
In the Google Cloud Console, select Navigation menu > BigQuery.
The Welcome to BigQuery in the Cloud Console message box opens. This message box provides a link to the quickstart guide and lists UI updates.
Click Done.

Create a BigQuery dataset
To create a dataset, click on the View actions icon next to your project ID and select Create dataset.
Next, name your Dataset ID demos and leave all other options at their default values, and then click Create dataset.

Verify the Cloud Storage bucket
A bucket should already exist that has the same name as the Project ID.
In the Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Cloud Storage > Buckets.
Observe the following values:
Property                            Value
                                    (type value or select option as specified)
Name                                PROJECT ID
Default storage class               Regional
Location                            Lab GCP Region









Task 3. Simulate traffic sensor data into Pub/Sub
In the training-vm SSH terminal, start the sensor simulator. The script reads sample data from a CSV file and publishes it to Pub/Sub:
/training/sensor_magic.sh

This command will send 1 hour of data in 1 minute. Let the script continue to run in the current terminal.


Open a second SSH terminal and connect to the training VM
In the upper right corner of the training-vm SSH terminal, click on the gear-shaped button (Settings icon) and select New Connection to training-vm from the drop-down menu. A new terminal window will open.
The new terminal session will not have the required environment variables. Run the following command to set them.
In the new training-vm SSH terminal enter the following:
source /training/project_env.sh


















Task 4. Launch Dataflow pipeline
Verify that Google Cloud Dataflow API is enabled for this project
To ensure that the proper APIs and permissions are set, execute the following block of code in the Cloud Shell.
gcloud services disable dataflow.googleapis.com --force
gcloud services enable dataflow.googleapis.com


Return to the second training-vm SSH terminal. Change into the directory for this lab.
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/streaming/process/sandiego

Identify the script that creates and runs the Dataflow pipeline.
cat run_oncloud.sh

Copy-and-paste the following URL into a new browser tab to view the source code on Github:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/streaming/process/sandiego/run_oncloud.sh

The script requires three arguments: project id, bucket name, classname
A 4th optional argument is options. The options argument discussed later in this lab.
project id          PROJECT ID
bucket name         Bucket Name
classname           <java file that runs aggregations>
options             <options>

There are 4 java files that you can choose from for classname. Each reads the traffic data from Pub/Sub and runs different aggregations/computations.


Go into the java directory. Identify the source file AverageSpeeds.java.
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/streaming/process/sandiego/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/training/dataanalyst/sandiego
cat AverageSpeeds.java

What does the script do?
Close the file to continue. You will want to refer to this source code while running the application. So for easy access you will open a new browser tab and view the file AverageSpeeds.java on Github.



Copy-and-paste the following URL into a browser tab to view the source code on Github:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/streaming/process/sandiego/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/training/dataanalyst/sandiego/AverageSpeeds.java

Leave this browser tab open. You will be referring back to the source code in a later step in this lab.



Return to the training-vm SSH terminal. Run the Dataflow pipeline to read from PubSub and write into BigQuery:
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/streaming/process/sandiego
./run_oncloud.sh $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID $BUCKET AverageSpeeds

This script uses maven to build a Dataflow streaming pipeline in Java.
Example successful completion:
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------















Task 5. Explore the pipeline
This Dataflow pipeline reads messages from a Pub/Sub topic, parses the JSON of the input message, produces one main output and writes to BigQuery.
Return to the browser tab for Console. On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Dataflow and click on your job to monitor progress.
Example:
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/5tVtB953BMyju7QibzMmH6S%2FwN29CBAwD9X2wEgEqEc%3D

Note: If Dataflow Job failed, run the command ./run_oncloud.sh $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID $BUCKET AverageSpeeds again.


After the pipeline is running, click on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Pub/Sub > Topics.
Examine the line for Topic name for the topic sandiego.
Return to the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Dataflow and click on your job.
Compare the code in the Github browser tab, AverageSpeeds.java and the pipeline graph on the page for your Dataflow job.
Find the GetMessages pipeline step in the graph, and then find the corresponding code in the AverageSpeeds.java file. This is the pipeline step that reads from the Pub/Sub topic. It creates a collection of Strings - which corresponds to Pub/Sub messages that have been read.
Do you see a subscription created?
How does the code pull messages from Pub/Sub?
Find the Time Window pipeline step in the graph and in code. In this pipeline step we create a window of a duration specified in the pipeline parameters (sliding window in this case). This window will accumulate the traffic data from the previous step until end of window, and pass it to the next steps for further transforms.
What is the window interval?
How often is a new window created?
Find the BySensor and AvgBySensor pipeline steps in the graph, and then find the corresponding code snippet in the AverageSpeeds.java file. This BySensor does a grouping of all events in the window by sensor id, while AvgBySensor will then compute the mean speed for each grouping.
Find the ToBQRow pipeline step in the graph and in code. This step simply creates a "row" with the average computed from the previous step together with the lane information.
Note: In practice, other actions could be taken in the ToBQRow step. For example, it could compare the calculated mean against a predefined threshold and log the results of the comparison in Cloud Logging.
Find the BigQueryIO.Write in both the pipeline graph and in the source code. This step writes the row out of the pipeline into a BigQuery table. Because we chose the WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND write disposition, new records will be appended to the table.
Return to the BigQuery web UI tab. Refresh your browser.
Find your project name and the demos dataset you created. The small arrow to the left of the dataset name demos should now be active and clicking on it will reveal the average_speeds table.
It will take several minutes before the average_speeds table appears in BigQuery.
Example:
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/AQ%2F6RAXQQLidJi%2BGJ976MrpD9DeIDJbo%2F4IbbTUCwbk%3D






















Task 6. Determine throughput rates
One common activity when monitoring and improving Dataflow pipelines is figuring out how many elements the pipeline processes per second, what the system lag is, and how many data elements have been processed so far. In this activity you will learn where in the Cloud Console one can find information about processed elements and time.
Return to the browser tab for Console. On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Dataflow and click on your job to monitor progress (it will have your username in the pipeline name).
Select the GetMessages pipeline node in the graph and look at the step metrics on the right.
System Lag is an important metric for streaming pipelines. It represents the amount of time data elements are waiting to be processed since they "arrived" in the input of the transformation step.
Elements Added metric under output collections tells you how many data elements exited this step (for the Read PubSub Msg step of the pipeline it also represents the number of Pub/Sub messages read from the topic by the Pub/Sub IO connector).
Select the Time Window node in the graph. Observe how the Elements Added metric under the Input Collections of the Time Window step matches the Elements Added metric under the Output Collections of the previous step GetMessages.













Task 7. Review BigQuery output
Return to the BigQuery web UI.
Note: Streaming data and tables may not show up immediately, and the Preview feature may not be available for data that is still in the streaming buffer.
If you click on Preview you will see the message "This table has records in the streaming buffer that may not be visible in the preview." You can still run queries to view the data.
In the Query editor window, type (or copy-and-paste) the following query. Use the following query to observe the output from the Dataflow job. Click Run:
SELECT *
FROM `demos.average_speeds`
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100

Find the last update to the table by running the following SQL:
SELECT
MAX(timestamp)
FROM
`demos.average_speeds`


Next use the time travel capability of BigQuery to reference the state of the table at a previous point in time.
The query below will return a subset of rows from the average_speeds table that existed at 10 minutes ago.
If your query requests rows but the table did not exist at the reference point in time, you will receive the following error message:
Invalid snapshot time 1633691170651 for Table PROJECT:DATASET.TABLE__

If you encounter this error please reduce the scope of your time travel by lowering the minute value:
SELECT *
FROM `demos.average_speeds`
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 10 MINUTE)
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100

















Task 8. Observe and understand autoscaling
Observe how Dataflow scales the number of workers to process the backlog of incoming Pub/Sub messages.
Return to the browser tab for Console. On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Dataflow and click on your pipeline job.
Examine the Job metrics panel on the right, and review the Autoscaling section. How many workers are currently being used to process messages in the Pub/Sub topic?
Click on More history and review how many workers were used at different points in time during pipeline execution.
The data from a traffic sensor simulator started at the beginning of the lab creates hundreds of messages per second in the Pub/Sub topic. This will cause Dataflow to increase the number of workers to keep the system lag of the pipeline at optimal levels.
Click on More history. In the Worker pool, you can see how Dataflow changed the number of workers. Notice the Status column that explains the reason for the change.

Task 9. Refresh the sensor data simulation script
Note: The training lab environment has quota limits. If the sensor data simulation script runs too long it will pass a quota limit, causing the session credentials to be suspended.
Return to the training-vm SSH terminal where the sensor data script is running.
If you see messages that say INFO: Publishing then the script is still running. Press CRTL+C to stop it. Then issue the command to start the script again:
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/streaming/publish
./send_sensor_data.py --speedFactor=60 --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

If the script has passed the quota limit, you will see repeating error messages that "credentials could not be refreshed" and you may not be able to use CTRL+C to stop the script. Simply close the SSH terminal. Open a new SSH terminal. The new session will have a fresh quota.
In the Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
Locate the line with the instance called training-vm.
On the far right, under Connect, click on SSH to open a third terminal window.
In the training-vm SSH terminal, enter the following to create environment variables:
source /training/project_env.sh

Use the following commands to start a new sensor simulator:
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/streaming/publish
./send_sensor_data.py --speedFactor=60 --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID


















Task 10. Cloud Monitoring integration
Cloud Monitoring integration with Dataflow allows users to access Dataflow job metrics such as System Lag (for streaming jobs), Job Status (Failed, Successful), Element Counts, and User Counters from within Cloud Monitoring.

Integration features of Cloud Monitoring
Explore Dataflow Metrics: Browse through available Dataflow pipeline metrics and visualize them in charts.
Some common Dataflow metrics.
Metrics	              Features
Job status	          Job status (Failed, Successful), reported as an enum every 30 secs and on update.
Elapsed time	        Job elapsed time (measured in seconds), reported every 30 secs.
System lag	          Max lag across the entire pipeline, reported in seconds.
Current vCPU count	  Current # of virtual CPUs used by the job and updated on value change.
Estimated byte count	Number of bytes processed per PCollection.

Chart Dataflow metrics in Monitoring Dashboards: Create Dashboards and chart time series of Dataflow metrics.
Configure Alerts: Define thresholds on job or resource group-level metrics and alert when these metrics reach specified values. Monitoring alerts notify on a variety of conditions such as long streaming system lag or failed jobs.
Monitor User-Defined Metrics: In addition to Dataflow metrics, Dataflow exposes user-defined metrics (SDK Aggregators) as Monitoring custom counters in the Monitoring UI, available for charting and alerting. Any Aggregator defined in a Dataflow pipeline will be reported to Monitoring as a custom metric. Dataflow will define a new custom metric on behalf of the user and report incremental updates to Monitoring approximately every 30 seconds.














Task 11. Explore metrics
Cloud monitoring is a separate service in Google Cloud. So you will need to go through some setup steps to initialize the service for your lab account.

Create a Monitoring workspace
You will now setup a Monitoring workspace that's tied to your Google Cloud Project. The following steps create a new account that has a free trial of Monitoring.
In the Cloud Console, click on Navigation menu > Monitoring.
Wait for your workspace to be provisioned.
When the Monitoring dashboard opens, your workspace is ready.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/58FQA3ZYeF1Uh01sWQnh5ymX4wPAAjryBAbPh92DHsY%3D



In the panel to the left click on Metrics explorer.
In the Metrics Explorer, under Resource & Metric click on Select a metric.
Select Dataflow Job > Job You should see a list of available Dataflow-related metrics. Select Data watermark lag and click Apply.
Cloud monitoring will draw a graph on the right side of the page.
Under metric, click on the Reset to remove the Data watermark lag metric. Select a new dataflow metric System lag.
Note: The metrics that Dataflow provides to Monitoring are listed in the Google Cloud metrics documentation. You can search on the page for Dataflow. The metrics you have viewed are useful indicators of pipeline performance.
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp
Data watermark lag: The age (time since event timestamp) of the most recent item of data that has been fully processed by the pipeline.
System lag: The current maximum duration that an item of data has been awaiting processing, in seconds.



















Task 12. Create alerts
If you want to be notified when a certain metric crosses a specified threshold (for example, when System Lag of our lab streaming pipeline increases above a predefined value), you could use the Alerting mechanisms of Monitoring to accomplish that.


Create an alert
On the Cloud Monitoring, click Alerting.
Click + Create policy.
Click on Select a metric dropdown. Disable the Show only active resources & metrics.
Type Dataflow Job in filter by resource and metric name and click on Dataflow Job > Job. Select System Lag and click Apply.
Click Next.
Set the Threshold position to Above threshold, Threshold value to 5 and Advanced options > Retest window to 1 min. Click Next.


Add a notification
Click on the drop down arrow next to Notification channels, then click on Manage notification channels.
A Notification channels page will open in a new tab.
Scroll down the page and click on Add new for Email.
In the Create email channel dialog box, enter the lab username as the Email address field and a Display name.
Note: If you enter your own email address, you might get alerts until all the resources in the project have been deleted.
Click Save.

Go back to the previous Create alerting policy tab.
Click on Notification channels again, then click on the Refresh icon to get the display name you mentioned in the previous step.
Now, select your Display name and click OK.
Set Alert name as MyAlertPolicy.
Click Next.
Review the alert and click Create policy.


View events
On the Cloud Monitoring tab, click on Alerting > Policies.
Every time an alert is triggered by a Metric Threshold condition, an Incident and a corresponding Event are created in Monitoring. If you specified a notification mechanism in the alert (email, SMS, pager, etc), you will also receive a notification.


















Task 13. Set up dashboards
You can easily build dashboards with the most relevant Dataflow-related charts with Cloud Monitoring Dashboards.
In the left pane, click Dashboards.
Click +Create dashboard.
For New dashboard name, type My Dashboard.
Click Line chart.
Click on the dropdown box under Resource & Metric.
Select Dataflow Job > Job > System Lag and click Apply.
In the Filters panel, click + Add filter.
Select project_id in the Label field, then select or type your GCP Project Id in the Value field.
Click Done.
Example:
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/UaChWbZd5SY5J5TsPHSLrHI2e%2Fb5Mx4rXYmO%2Bw7rO58%3D

You can add more charts to the dashboard, if you would like, for example, Pub/Sub publish rates on the topic, or subscription backlog (which is a signal to the Dataflow auto-scaler).
