Task 5. Query to search application
Step 3.
I have an "ai applications" called cymbal-finance. 
How do i send search requests from the command line using the Discovery Engine APIs and the default_search:search endpoint. 
Search request using the sentence "What investments has Alphabet made in AI?"



Open Google Cloud Shell

Run
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/qwiklabs-gcp-00-e5918f754f09/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/cymbal-finance/servingConfigs/default_search:search" \
-d '{
     "servingConfig": "projects/qwiklabs-gcp-00-e5918f754f09/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/cymbal-finance/servingConfigs/default_search",
     "query": "What investments has Alphabet made in AI?"
}'


Response

  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "We were unable to find an engine to service the request. This may be an intermittent issue -- please try again in 3-5 minutes. If the issue persists, please contact support.",
