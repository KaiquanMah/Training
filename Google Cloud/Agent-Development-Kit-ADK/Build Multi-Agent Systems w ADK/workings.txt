Build Multi-Agent Systems w ADK


Objectives
- Create MULTIPLE AGENTS and relate them to one another with parent to sub-agent relationships.
- Build content across MULTIPLE TURNS of CONVO and multiple agents by writing to a session's state dictionary.
- Instruct agents to read values from the SESSION STATE to use as context for their responses.
- Use workflow agents to pass the conversation between agents directly.






Multi-Agent Systems
The Agent Development Kit empowers developers to get more reliable, sophisticated, multi-step behaviors from generative models. Instead of writing long, complex prompts that may not deliver results reliably, you can construct a flow of multiple, simple agents that can collaborate on complex problems by dividing tasks and responsibilities.

This architectural approach offers several key advantages such as:
1
Easier to design: You can think in terms of agents with SPECIFIC jobs and SKILLS
2
SPECIALISED FUNCTIONS with more reliable performance: Specialized agents can learn from clear examples to become more reliable at their specific tasks.
3
Organization: Dividing the workflow into DISTINCT AGENTS allows for a more organized, and therefor easier to think about, approach.
4
Improvability and MAINTAINABILITY: It is easier to improve or fix a specialized component rather than make changes to a complex agent that may fix one behavior but might impact others.
5
Modularity: Distinct agents from one workflow can be easily copied and included in other similar workflows.








The Hierarchical Agent Tree
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/hc9s%2BOp9Z7JMMXEZLxYoHF%2Bi6Zm1aSaRgjeWOc%2BO7oY%3D

In Agent Development Kit, you organize your agents in a tree-like structure. This helps LIMIT the options for TRANSFERS for each agent in the tree, making it EASIER to control and PREDICT the possible ROUTES the conversation can take through the tree. Benefits of the hierarchical structure include:

- It draws inspiration from real-world collaborative teams, making it easier to design and reason about the behavior of the multi-agent system.

- It is intuitive for developers, as it mirrors common software development patterns.

- It provides greater control over the flow of information and task delegation within the system, making it easier to understand possible pathways and debug the system. For example, if a system has 2 report-generation agents at different parts of its flow with similar descriptions, the tree structure makes it easier to ensure that the correct one is invoked.

The structure always begins with the agent defined in the `root_agent` variable (although it may have a different user-facing name to identify itself). The root_agent may act as a parent to one or more sub-agents. Each sub-agent agent may have its own sub-agents.

Task 1. Install ADK and set up your environment

In this lab environment, the Vertex AI API has been enabled for you. If you were to follow these steps in your own project, you would enable it by navigating to Vertex AI and following the prompt to enable it.






Prepare a Cloud Shell Editor tab
With your Google Cloud console window selected, open Cloud Shell by pressing the G key and then the S key on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can click the Activate Cloud Shell button (Activate Cloud Shell) in the upper right of the Cloud console.

Click Continue.

When prompted to authorize Cloud Shell, click Authorize.

In the upper right corner of the Cloud Shell Terminal panel, click the Open in new window button Open in new window button.

In the Cloud Shell Terminal, enter the following to open the Cloud Shell Editor to your home directory:
```
cloudshell workspace ~
```
Close any additional tutorial or Gemini panels that appear on the right side of the screen to save more of your window for your code editor.

Throughout the rest of this lab, you can work in this window as your IDE with the Cloud Shell Editor and Cloud Shell Terminal.













Download and install ADK and code samples for this lab
Paste the following commands into the Cloud Shell Terminal to copy code files from a Cloud Storage bucket for this lab:
```
gcloud storage cp -r gs://qwiklabs-gcp-01-3049dd15d466-bucket/adk_multiagent_systems .
```

Update your PATH environment variable, install ADK, and install additional lab requirements by running the following commands in the Cloud Shell Terminal.
```
export PATH=$PATH:"/home/${USER}/.local/bin"
python3 -m pip install google-adk -r adk_multiagent_systems/requirements.txt
```



student_00_eeb939364b69@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-01-3049dd15d466)$ echo $PATH
/opt/gradle/bin:/opt/maven/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/node_packages/node_modules/.bin:/usr/local/rvm/bin:/home/student_00_eeb939364b69/.gems/bin:/usr/local/rvm/bin:/home/student_00_eeb939364b69/gopath/bin:/google/gopath/bin:/google/flutter/bin:/usr/local/nvm/versions/node/v24.11.1/bin:/home/student_00_eeb939364b69/.local/bin









=================


Task 2. Explore transfers between parent, sub-agent, and peer agents


The conversation always begins with the agent defined as the `root_agent` variable.

The default behavior of a parent agent is to UNDERSTAND the DESCRIPTION of EACH SUB-AGENT and determine if control of the conversation should be transferred to a sub-agent at any point.

You can help guide those transfers in the parent's instruction by referring to the sub-agents by name (the values of their NAME PARAMETER, not their variable names). Try an example:



In the Cloud Shell Terminal, run the following to create a .env file to authenticate the agent in the parent_and_subagents directory.
```
cd ~/adk_multiagent_systems
cat << EOF > parent_and_subagents/.env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=qwiklabs-gcp-01-3049dd15d466
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global
MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
EOF
```


Run the following command to copy that .env file to the workflow_agents directory, which you will use later in the lab:
```
cp parent_and_subagents/.env workflow_agents/.env
```



In the Cloud Shell Editor file explorer pane, navigate to the adk_multiagent_systems/parent_and_subagents directory.

Click on the agent.py file to open it.

Tip: Because Python code requires that we define our sub-agents before we can add them to an agent, in order to read an agent.py file in the order of the conversation flow, you may want to start reading with the bottom agent and work back towards the top.



Notice that there are three agents here:
1
a root_agent named steering (its name is used to identify it in ADK's dev UI and command line interfaces). It asks the user a question (if they know where they'd like to travel or if they need some help deciding), and the user's response to that question will help this steering agent know which of its two sub-agents to steer the conversation towards. Notice that it only has a simple instruction that does not mention the sub-agents, but it is aware of its sub-agents' descriptions.
2
a travel_brainstormer that helps the user brainstorm destinations if they don't know where they would like to visit.
3
an attractions_planner that helps the user build a list of things to do once they know which country they would like to visit.



Make travel_brainstormer and attractions_planner sub-agents of the root_agent by adding the following line to the creation of the root_agent:
```
sub_agents=[travel_brainstormer, attractions_planner]
```

Save the file.







Note that you don't add a corresponding parent parameter to the sub-agents. The hierarchical tree is defined only by specifying sub_agents when creating parent agents.

In the Cloud Shell Terminal, run the following to use the ADK command line interface to chat with your agent:
```
# cd ~/adk_multiagent_systems
adk run parent_and_subagents
```




student_00_eeb939364b69@cloudshell:~/adk_multiagent_systems (qwiklabs-gcp-01-3049dd15d466)$ adk run parent_and_subagents

Notice from the name [travel_brainstormer] in brackets in the response that the root_agent (named [steering]) has transferred the conversation to the appropriate sub-agent based on that sub-agent's description alone.















You can also provide your agent more detailed instructions about when to transfer to a sub-agent as part of its instructions. In the agent.py file, add the following lines to the root_agent's instruction:
```
If they need help deciding, send them to
'travel_brainstormer'.
If they know what country they'd like to visit,
send them to the 'attractions_planner'.
```
Save the file.



In the Cloud Shell Terminal, run the following to start the command line interface again:
```
adk run parent_and_subagents
```


Running agent steering, type exit to exit.
[user]: hello
[steering]: Hello! Do you know where you'd like to travel, or would you like some help deciding?




# Notice that you have been transferred to the other sub-agent, attractions_planner.

[user]: I would like to go to kazakhstan
[attractions_planner]: Kazakhstan, what a fantastic choice! It's a country with incredible natural beauty and a rich history. To help me suggest the best attractions for you, could you tell me a little bit about what you're interested in? Are you looking for historical sites, natural wonders, cultural experiences, or something else?



# Notice below you have been transferred to the travel_brainstormer agent, which is a peer agent to the attractions_planner. This is allowed by default. If you wanted to prevent transfers to peers, you could have set the disallow_transfer_to_peers parameter to True on the attractions_planner agent.

[user]: Actually I don't know what country to visit.
[travel_brainstormer]: No worries at all! It's completely understandable to feel undecided with so many amazing places in the world.

Let's go back to the drawing board. To help you figure out what country might be a great fit, consider these popular options again:

*   **Italy:** History, art, amazing food, and stunning scenery.
*   **France:** Romantic cities, iconic landmarks, delicious cuisine, and diverse regions.
*   **Japan:** A unique mix of ancient traditions and modern innovation, beautiful nature, and vibrant cities.
*   **Thailand:** Beautiful beaches, ancient temples, bustling markets, and flavorful food.
*   **New Zealand:** Breathtaking natural beauty, adventure sports, and unique culture.

To give you the best recommendations, could you tell me what you're hoping for in a trip? Are you primarily looking for:

*   **Adventure** (hiking, extreme sports, exploring wilderness)
*   **Leisure/Relaxation** (beaches, spas, quiet retreats)
*   **Learning/Culture** (historical sites, museums, local traditions)
*   **Shopping** (markets, boutiques, unique crafts)
*   **Viewing Art** (galleries, street art, architectural wonders)

Or perhaps a combination of these?








[user]: suggest kazakhstan attractions pls
[attractions_planner]: Kazakhstan offers a unique blend of natural beauty, historical sites, and modern architecture. Here are some attractions you might consider:

**Nature and Outdoors:**
*   **Charyn Canyon:** Often compared to the Grand Canyon, this spectacular natural monument features stunning rock formations and is great for hiking.
*   **Big Almaty Lake:** A picturesque alpine lake with vibrant turquoise waters, surrounded by majestic mountains. It's a popular spot for day trips and photography.
*   **Kolsai Lakes (Kolsai National Park):** A cascade of three stunning mountain lakes, known for their clear water and surrounding coniferous forests. Ideal for trekking, horseback riding, and camping.
*   **Lake Kaindy:** Famous for its submerged forest, where the trunks of spruce trees rise out of the cold, turquoise water. It's a truly unique and surreal sight.
*   **Altyn-Emel National Park:** Home to the Singing Dunes, Aktau Mountains (colorful chalk mountains), and Katutau Mountains (volcanic rock formations).

**Cities and Culture:**
*   **Almaty:** Kazakhstan's largest city and former capital, known for its tree-lined streets, Soviet-era architecture, and vibrant cultural scene. Don't miss Panfilov Park, Zenkov Cathedral, and Kok Tobe hill for panoramic views.
*   **Astana (Nur-Sultan):** The futuristic capital city, famous for its avant-garde architecture, including the Bayterek Tower, Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, and Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center.
*   **Turkistan:** A historic city and spiritual center, home to the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, a UNESCO World Heritage site and an important pilgrimage destination.
*   **Shymkent:** One of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan, offering a glimpse into traditional Kazakh culture, bustling bazaars, and nearby ancient ruins.

**Historical Sites:**
*   **Tamgaly Petroglyphs:** Another UNESCO World Heritage site, featuring thousands of ancient rock carvings depicting various scenes from prehistoric life.
*   **Aisha Bibi Mausoleum:** A beautiful 11th- or 12th-century mausoleum known for its intricate terracotta tile work, located near Taraz.

To help me narrow down suggestions, are you more interested in:
1.  **Nature and outdoor activities?**
2.  **City exploration and culture?**
3.  **Historical sites and ancient history?**
4.  **A mix of everything?**

Task 3. Use session state to store and retrieve specific information Workflow Agents


Each conversation in ADK is contained within a Session that all agents involved in the conversation can access. A session includes the conversation history, which agents read as part of the context used to generate a response. The session also includes a session state dictionary that you can use to take greater control over the most important pieces of information you would like to highlight and how they are accessed.

This can be particularly helpful to pass information between agents or to maintain a simple data structure, like a list of tasks, over the course of a conversation with a user.



To explore adding to and reading from state:
Return to the file adk_multiagent_systems/parent_and_subagents/agent.py

Paste the following function definition after the # Tools header:
```
def save_attractions_to_state(
    tool_context: ToolContext,
    attractions: List[str]
) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Saves the list of attractions to state["attractions"].

    Args:
        attractions [str]: a list of strings to add to the list of attractions

    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Load existing attractions from state. If none exist, start an empty list
    existing_attractions = tool_context.state.get("attractions", [])

    # Update the 'attractions' key with a combo of old and new lists.
    # When the tool is run, ADK will create an event and make
    # corresponding updates in the session's state.
    tool_context.state["attractions"] = existing_attractions + attractions

    # A best practice for tools is to return a status message in a return dict
    return {"status": "success"}
```

In this code, notice:

- The session is passed to your tool function as ToolContext. 
All you need to do is assign a parameter to receive it, as you see here with the parameter named tool_context. You can then use tool_context to access session information like conversation history (through tool_context.events) and the session state dictionary (through tool_context.state). 
When the tool_context.state dictionary is modified by your tool function, those changes will be reflected in the session's state after the tool finishes its execution.

- The docstring provides a clear description and sections for argument and return values.

- The commented function code demonstrates how easy it is to make updates to the state dictionary.








Add the tool to the attractions_planner agent by adding the tools parameter when the agent is created:
```
tools=[save_attractions_to_state]
```

Add the following bullet points to the attractions_planner agent's existing instruction:
```
- When they reply, use your tool to save their selected attraction
and then provide more possible attractions.
- If they ask to view the list, provide a bulleted list of
{ attractions? } and then suggest some more.
```


Notice the section in curly braces: { attractions? }. This ADK feature, key templating (https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/state/#using-key-templating), 
loads the value of the attractions key from the state dictionary. 
The question mark '?' after the attractions key PREVENTS this from ERRORING IF THE FIELD IS NOT YET PRESENT.




You will now run the agent from the web interface, which provides a tab for you to see the changes being made to the session state. Launch the Agent Development Kit Web UI with the following command:
```
adk web
```
To view the web interface in a new tab, click the http://127.0.0.1:8000 link in the Terminal output.
A new browser tab will open with the ADK Dev UI.
From the Select an agent dropdown on the left, select the parent_and_subagents agent from the dropdown.
Start the conversation with: hello



After the agent greets you, reply with:
```
I'd like to go to Egypt.
```
You should be transferred to the attractions_planner and be provided a list of attractions.

Choose an attraction, for example:
```
I'll go to the Sphinx
```
You should receive an acknowledgement in the response, like: 
Okay, I've saved The Sphinx to your list. Here are some other attractions...








Click the response tool box (marked with a check mark) to view the event created from the tool's response. Notice that it includes an actions field which includes state_delta describing the changes to the state.

You should be prompted by the agent to select more attractions. Reply to the agent by naming one of the options it has presented.

On the left-hand navigation menu, click the "X" to exit the focus on the event you inspected earlier.


Now in the sidebar, you should see the list of events and a few tab options. Select the State tab. Here you can view the current state, including your attractions array with the two values you have requested.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/ILEPEgsj0jm36NlN1fZKw06%2BbOgoKvdm2lSOrWfP2GE%3D



Send this message to the agent:
```
What is on my list?
```


It should return your list formatted as a bulleted list according to its instruction.

When you are finished experimenting with the agent, close the web browser tab and press CTRL + C in the Cloud Shell Terminal to stop the server.

Later in this lab, you will demonstrate how to use state to communicate between agents.

Instead of saving small pieces of information, if you would like to store your agent's entire text response in the state dictionary, you can set an `output_key` parameter when you define the agent, and its entire output will be stored in the state dictionary under that field name.








=================



Workflow Agents

Parent to sub-agent transfers are ideal when you have multiple specialist sub-agents, and you want the user to interact with each of them.

However, if you would like agents to act one-after-another WITHOUT WAITING for a turn from the user, you can use workflow agents.

Some example scenarios when you might use workflow agents include when you would like your agents to:
1
Plan and Execute: When you want to have 1 AGENT PLAN/prepare a list of items, and then have OTHER AGENTS use that list to PERFORM follow-up tasks, for example writing sections of a document
2
Research and Write: When you want to have one agent call functions to collect contextual information from Google Search or other data sources, then another agent use that information to produce some output.
3
Draft and Revise: When you want to have one agent prepare a draft of a document, and then have other agents check the work and iterate on it


To accomplish these kinds of tasks, workflow agents have sub-agents and guarantee that each of their sub-agents acts. Agent Development Kit provides three built-in workflow agents and the opportunity to define your own:
- SequentialAgent
- LoopAgent
- ParallelAgent



Throughout the rest of this lab, you will build a multi-agent system that uses multiple LLM agents, workflow agents, and tools to help control the flow of the agent.

Specifically, you will build an agent that will develop a pitch document for a new hit movie: a biographical film based on the life of a historical character. 
Your sub-agents will handle 
- the RESEARCH,
- an ITERATIVE WRITING loop with a screenwriter and a critic, and finally
- some additional sub-agents will help brainstorm casting IDEAS and use historical box office data to make some PREDICTIONS about box office results.


In the end, your multi-agent system will look like this (you can click on the image to see it larger):
Diagram of a film_concept_team multi-agent system
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/9o3xwlTjCWnoyd9fEEgInAHYJbCQHiU5JIYIN8rU9KY%3D


But you will begin with a simpler version.








=================


Task 4. Begin building a multi-agent system with a SequentialAgent






The SequentialAgent executes its sub-agents in a linear sequence. Each sub-agent in its sub_agents list is run, one after the other, in the order they are defined.

This is ideal for workflows where tasks must be performed in a specific order, and the output of one task serves as the input for the next.

In this task, you will run a SequentialAgent to build a first version of your movie pitch-development multi-agent system. The first draft of your agent will be structured like this:
Film_concept_team multi-agent system steps

greeter
>>researcher w Wikipedia tool
>>screenwriter drafts
>>file_writer writes to file



A root_agent named greeter to welcome the user and request a historical character as a movie subject

A SequentialAgent called film_concept_team will include:
1
A researcher to learn more about the requested historical figure from Wikipedia, using a LangChain tool covered in the lab Empower ADK agents with tools. An agent can choose to call its tool(s) multiple times in succession, so the researcher can take multiple turns in a row if it determines it needs to do more research.
2
A screenwriter to turn the research into a PLOT outline.
3
A file_writer to title the resulting movie and write the results of the sequence to a FILE.








In the Cloud Shell Editor, navigate to the directory 
adk_multiagent_systems/workflow_agents

Click on the agent.py file in the workflow_agents directory.

Read through this agent definition file. Because sub-agents must be defined before they can be assigned to a parent, to read the file in the order of the conversational flow, you can read the agents from the bottom of the file to the top.

You also have a function tool append_to_state. This function allows agents with the tool the ability to add content to a dictionary value in state. It is particularly useful for agents that might call a tool multiple times or act in multiple passes of a LoopAgent, so that each time they act their output is stored.






Try out the current version of the agent by launching the web interface from the Cloud Shell Terminal. You will use the --reload_agents argument to enable live reloading of agents based on agent changes:
```
# cd ~/adk_multiagent_systems
adk web --reload_agents
```
Note: If you did not shut down your previous adk web session, the default port of 8000 will be blocked, but you can launch the Dev UI with a new port by using adk web --port 8001, for example.


To view the web interface in a new tab, click the http://127.0.0.1:8000 link in the Terminal output.
A new browser tab will open with the ADK Dev UI.
From the Select an agent dropdown on the left, select workflow_agents.

Start the conversation with: hello.
It may take a few moments for the agent to respond, but it should request you enter a historical figure to start your film plot generation.



When prompted to enter a historical figure, you can enter one of your choice or use one of these examples:
- Zhang Zhongjing - a renowned Chinese physician from the 2nd Century CE.
- Ada Lovelace - an English mathematician and writer known for her work on early computers
- Marcus Aurelius - a Roman emperor known for his philosophical writings.

The agent should now call its agents one after the other as it executes the workflow and writes the plot outline file to your ~/adk_multiagent_systems/movie_pitches directory. It should inform you when it has written the file to disk.

If you don't see the agent reporting that it generated a file for you or want to try another character, you can click + New Session in the upper right and try again.

View the agent's output in the Cloud Shell Editor. (You may need to use the Cloud Shell Editor's menu to enable View > Word Wrap to see the full text without lots of horizontal scrolling.)

In the ADK Dev UI, click on one of the agent icons (agent_icon) representing a turn of conversation to bring up the event view.

The event view provides a visual representation of the tree of agents and tools used in this session. You may need to scroll in the event panel to see the full plot.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/13FyRaWAhz%2B4P0TGiyaiGmU0IGRoARIfQlYcGasMy4o%3D



In addition to the graph view, you can click on the Request tab of the event to see the information this agent received as part of its request, including the conversation history.
You can also click on the Response tab of the event to see what the agent returned.

Note: While this system can produce interesting results, it is not intended to imply that instructions can be so brief or adding examples can be skipped. The system's reliability would benefit greatly from the additional layer of adding more rigorous instructions and examples for each agent.









=================


Task 5. Add a LoopAgent for iterative work


The LoopAgent executes its sub-agents in a defined sequence and then starts at the beginning of the sequence again without breaking for a user input. It repeats the loop until a number of iterations has been reached or a call to exit the loop has been made by one of its sub-agents (usually by calling a built-in exit_loop tool).

This is beneficial for tasks that require continuous refinement, monitoring, or cyclical workflows. Examples include:
1
Iterative Refinement: Continuously improve a document or plan through repeated agent cycles.
2
Continuous Monitoring: Periodically check data sources or conditions using a sequence of agents.
3
Debate or Negotiation: Simulate iterative discussions between agents to reach a better outcome.


You will add a LoopAgent to your movie pitch agent to allow multiple rounds of research and iteration while crafting the story. In addition to refining the script, this allows a user to start with a less specific input: instead of suggesting a specific historical figure, they might only know they want a story about an ancient doctor, and a research-and-writing iteration loop will allow the agents to find a good candidate, then work on the story.

- critic feedback -> back to researcher OR move on to file_writer



Your revised agent will flow like this:
1
The root_agent greeter will remain the same.

2
The film_concept_team SequentialAgent will now consist of:
- A writers_room LoopAgent that will begin the sequence. It will consist of:
    The researcher will be the same as before.
    The screenwriter will be similar to before.
    A critic that will offer critical feedback on the current draft to motivate the next round of research and improvement through the loop.

- When the loop terminates, it will escalate control of the conversation back to the film_concept_team SequentialAgent, which will then pass control to the next agent in its sequence: the file_writer that will remain as before to give the movie a title and write the results of the sequence to a file.








To make these changes:

In the adk_multiagent_systems/workflow_agents/agent.py file, add this tool import so that you can provide an agent the ability to exit the loop when desired:
```
from google.adk.tools import exit_loop
```
To determine when to exit the loop, add this critic agent to decide when the plot outline is ready. Paste the following new agent into the agent.py file under the # Agents section header (without overwriting the existing agents). Note that it has the exit_loop tool as one of its tools and instructions on when to use it:
```
critic = Agent(
    name="critic",
    model=model_name,
    description="Reviews the outline so that it can be improved.",
    instruction="""
    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Consider these questions about the PLOT_OUTLINE:
    - Does it meet a satisfying three-act cinematic structure?
    - Do the characters' struggles seem engaging?
    - Does it feel grounded in a real time period in history?
    - Does it sufficiently incorporate historical details from the RESEARCH?

    If the PLOT_OUTLINE does a good job with these questions, exit the writing loop with your 'exit_loop' tool.
    If significant improvements can be made, use the 'append_to_state' tool to add your feedback to the field 'CRITICAL_FEEDBACK'.
    Explain your decision and briefly summarize the feedback you have provided.

    PLOT_OUTLINE:
    { PLOT_OUTLINE? }

    RESEARCH:
    { research? }
    """,
    before_model_callback=log_query_to_model,
    after_model_callback=log_model_response,
    tools=[append_to_state, exit_loop]
)
```


Create a new LoopAgent called writers_room that creates the iterative loop of the researcher, screenwriter, and critic. Each pass through the loop will end with a critical review of the work so far, which will prompt improvements for the next round. Paste the following above the existing film_concept_team SequentialAgent.
```
writers_room = LoopAgent(
    name="writers_room",
    description="Iterates through research and writing to improve a movie plot outline.",
    sub_agents=[
        researcher,
        screenwriter,
        critic
    ],
    max_iterations=5,
)
```


Note that the LoopAgent creation includes a parameter for max_iterations. This defines how many times the loop will run before it ends. Even if you plan to interrupt the loop via another method, it is a good idea to include a cap on the total number of iterations.

Update the film_concept_team SequentialAgent to replace the researcher and screenwriter with the writers_room LoopAgent you just created. The file_writer agent should remain at the end of the sequence. The film_concept_team should now look like this:
```
film_concept_team = SequentialAgent(
    name="film_concept_team",
    description="Write a film plot outline and save it as a text file.",
    sub_agents=[
        writers_room,
        file_writer
    ],
)
```
Return to the ADK Dev UI tab and click the + New Session button in the upper right to start a new session.

Begin a new conversation with: hello

When prompted to choose a kind of historical character, choose one that interests you. Some ideas include:
- an industrial designer who made products for the masses
- a cartographer (a map maker)
- that guy who made crops yield more food

Once you have chosen a type of character, the agent should work its way through iterations of the loop and finally give the film a title and write the outline to a file.

Using the Cloud Shell Editor, review the file generated, which should be saved in the adk_multiagent_systems/movie_pitches directory. (Once again, you may need to use the Editor's menu to enable View > Word Wrap to see the full text without lots of horizontal scrolling.)









=================


Task 6. Use a "fan out and gather" pattern for report generation with a ParallelAgent



The ParallelAgent enables concurrent execution of its sub-agents. Each sub-agent operates in its own branch, and by default, they do not share conversation history or state directly with each other during parallel execution.

This is valuable for tasks that can be divided into independent sub-tasks that can be processed simultaneously. Using a ParallelAgent can significantly reduce the overall execution time for such tasks.

In this lab, you will add some supplemental reports -- some research on potential box office performance and some initial ideas on casting -- to enhance the pitch for your new film.

The film_concept_team SequentialAgent will now consist of:
- The writers_room LoopAgent, which will remain the same including:
    The researcher agent
    The screenwriter agent
    The critic agent

- Your new preproduction_team ParallelAgent will then act, consisting of:
    A box_office_researcher agent to use historical box office data to generate a report on potential box office performance for this film
    A casting_agent agent to generate some initial ideas on casting based on actors who have starred in similar films

3
The file_writer that will remain as before to write the results of the sequence to a file.








While much of this example demonstrates creative work that would be done by human teams, this workflow represents how a complex chain of tasks can be broken across several sub-agents to produce drafts of complex documents which human team members can then edit and improve upon.

Paste the following new agents and ParallelAgent into your workflow_agents/agent.py file under the # Agents header:
```
box_office_researcher = Agent(
    name="box_office_researcher",
    model=model_name,
    description="Considers the box office potential of this film",
    instruction="""
    PLOT_OUTLINE:
    { PLOT_OUTLINE? }

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Write a report on the box office potential of a movie like that described in PLOT_OUTLINE based on the reported box office performance of other recent films.
    """,
    output_key="box_office_report"

casting_agent = Agent(
    name="casting_agent",

    instruction="""
    PLOT_OUTLINE:
    { PLOT_OUTLINE? }

preproduction_team = ParallelAgent(
    name="preproduction_team",
    sub_agents=[
        box_office_researcher,
        casting_agent
    ]
)
```


Update the existing film_concept_team agent's sub_agents list to include the preproduction_team between the writers_room and file_writer:
```
film_concept_team = SequentialAgent(
    name="film_concept_team",
    description="Write a film plot outline and save it as a text file.",
    sub_agents=[
        writers_room,
        preproduction_team,
        file_writer
    ],
)
```



Update the file_writer's instruction to:
```
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create a marketable, contemporary movie title suggestion for the movie described in the PLOT_OUTLINE. If a title has been suggested in PLOT_OUTLINE, you can use it, or replace it with a better one.
- Use your 'write_file' tool to create a new txt file with the following arguments:
    - for a filename, use the movie title
    - Write to the 'movie_pitches' directory.
    - For the 'content' to write, include:
        - The PLOT_OUTLINE
        - The BOX_OFFICE_REPORT
        - The CASTING_REPORT

PLOT_OUTLINE:
{ PLOT_OUTLINE? }

BOX_OFFICE_REPORT:
{ box_office_report? }

CASTING_REPORT:
{ casting_report? }
```
Save the file.




In the ADK Dev UI, click + New Session in the upper right.

Enter hello to start the conversation.

When prompted, enter a new character idea that you are interested in. Some ideas include:
- that actress who invented the technology for wifi
- an exciting chef
- key players in the worlds fair exhibitions

When the agent has completed its writing and report-generation, inspect the file it produced in the adk_multiagent_systems/movie_pitches directory. If a part of the process fails, click + New session in the upper right and try again.

Custom workflow agents


When the pre-defined workflow agents of SequentialAgent, LoopAgent, and ParallelAgent are insufficient for your needs, CustomAgent provides the flexibility to implement new workflow logic. 
You can define patterns for 
- flow control,
- conditional execution, or
- state management between sub-agents. 
This is useful for complex workflows, stateful orchestrations, or integrating custom business logic into the framework's orchestration layer.



Creation of a `CustomAgent` is out of the scope of this lab, but it is good to know that it exists if you need it

Reflections
- An intro to sequentialagent, loopagent, parallelagent
- Looking forward to a tutorial on CustomAgent, and more time to create some research report outside of the topic of movies (to simulate a real world research task)
