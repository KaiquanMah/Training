      "Chiropractic is an alternative medicine focused on musculoskeletal disorders, especially of the spine. It involves manual therapy, exercises, and lifestyle counseling. While chiropractors hold a D.C. degree, they are not M.D.s or D.O.s. Historically, some chiropractors claimed spinal manipulation improved general health. There is no strong evidence for its effectiveness in managing lower back pain, and its safety is not fully established, with mild to moderate adverse effects being common and serious complications rare. The practice has faced controversy due to its pseudoscientific foundations, such as the concepts of vertebral subluxation and Innate Intelligence, and its founder D.D. Palmer's claim of receiving it from \"the other world.\" The American Medical Association once called it an \"unscientific cult.\" Despite these criticisms, chiropractic has gained more legitimacy and acceptance over time, though some practitioners still spread misinformation, particularly regarding vaccines."

      "**Logline:** A pioneering chiropractor, driven by a deep desire to heal, battles against the pseudoscientific dogma of his own profession and the skepticism of the medical establishment to forge a legitimate path for spinal health.\n\n**Three-Act Plot Outline:**\n\n**Act 1: The Promise of a New Way**\n*   **Introduction to a passionate, idealistic chiropractor (e.g., Dr. Elias Thorne) in the early 20th century.** He believes wholeheartedly in the \"Innate Intelligence\" and the power of spinal adjustments to cure all ailments, inspired by the dramatic recovery of a patient.\n*   **Establish the burgeoning chiropractic community:** a tight-knit group of believers, often seen as outsiders or even charlatans by the established medical community. Elias experiences early successes, building a loyal patient base who feel abandoned by conventional medicine.\n*   **Rising conflict:** The medical establishment, represented by a skeptical but well-meaning doctor (e.g., Dr. Eleanor Vance), publicly dismisses chiropractic as an \"unscientific cult,\" leading to legal challenges and social ostracization for Elias and his peers. Elias, however, remains steadfast in his conviction.\n\n**Act 2: A Crisis of Faith and Scientific Awakening**\n*   **A pivotal case:** Elias takes on a complex patient (e.g., a child with a severe, non-musculoskeletal condition) whose health deteriorates despite his most fervent \"adjustments\" and reliance on \"Innate Intelligence.\" This failure deeply shakes Elias's core beliefs.\n*   **Internal and external conflict:** Elias begins to secretly research anatomy, physiology, and evidence-based practices, questioning the pseudoscientific tenets of his training. This leads to clashes with his dogmatic mentor and the traditional chiropractic leadership, who accuse him of betrayal.\n*   **Seeking new knowledge:** Elias cautiously reaches out to Dr. Vance, initially for medical records, leading to a tense but intellectually stimulating exchange. He starts to integrate exercises, lifestyle advice, and a more focused, musculoskeletal approach into his practice, alienating some traditional patients but gaining new ones.\n\n**Act 3: Forging Legitimacy**\n*   **The ultimate test:** Elias's refined, more evidence-based approach is put to the test with a high-stakes case – perhaps a patient with chronic, debilitating back pain who has found no relief elsewhere. He must prove his methods are effective and safe, not just anecdotal.\n*   **Confrontation and advocacy:** Elias publicly advocates for a more scientific and responsible chiropractic practice, challenging the old guard within his profession and seeking dialogue with the medical community. This could culminate in a public hearing or a pivotal presentation.\n*   **Resolution:** Elias doesn't achieve universal acceptance overnight, but his dedication to genuine healing and his willingness to evolve his practice earns him respect. He establishes a legitimate clinic that bridges the gap between alternative and conventional care, inspiring a new generation of chiropractors to pursue evidence-based practices, even as the broader debate continues. The film ends with a sense of progress and the ongoing journey towards integration and understanding."

                "result": "Page: Chiropractic\nSummary: Chiropractic () is a form of alternative medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially of the spine.  The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling. Most who seek chiropractic care do so for low back pain.  Chiropractic is well established in the United States, Canada, and Australia, along with other manual-therapy professions such as osteopathy and physical therapy.\nMany chiropractors (often known informally as chiros), especially those in the field's early history, have proposed that mechanical disorders affect general health, and that regular manipulation of the spine (spinal adjustment) improves general health.  A chiropractor may have a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree and be referred to as \"doctor\" but is not a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.). While many chiropractors view themselves as primary care providers, chiropractic clinical training does not meet the requirements for that designation. A small but significant number of chiropractors spread vaccine misinformation, promote unproven dietary supplements, or administer full-spine x-rays.\nThere is no good evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective in helping manage lower back pain. A 2011 critical evaluation of 45 systematic reviews concluded that the data included in the study \"fail[ed] to demonstrate convincingly that spinal manipulation is an effective intervention for any condition.\" Spinal manipulation may be cost-effective for sub-acute or chronic low back pain, but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient. No compelling evidence exists to indicate that maintenance chiropractic care adequately prevents symptoms or diseases.\nThere is not sufficient data to establish the safety of chiropractic manipulations. It is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects, with serious or fatal complications in rare cases. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of vertebral artery dissection, which can lead to stroke and death, from cervical manipulation. Several deaths have been associated with this technique and it has been suggested that the relationship is causative, a claim which is disputed by many chiropractors.\nChiropractic is based on several pseudoscientific ideas. Spiritualist D. D. Palmer founded chiropractic in the 1890s, claiming that he had received it from \"the other world\", from a doctor who had died 50 years previously. Throughout its history, chiropractic has been controversial. Its foundation is at odds with evidence-based medicine, and is underpinned by pseudoscientific ideas such as vertebral subluxation and Innate Intelligence.   Despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is an effective public health intervention, there are significant disagreements among chiropractors over the subject, which has led to negative impacts on both public vaccination and mainstream acceptance of chiropractic. The American Medical Association called chiropractic an \"unscientific cult\" in 1966 and boycotted it until losing an antitrust case in 1987. Chiropractic has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services. In the last decades of the twentieth century, it gained more legitimacy and greater acceptance among conventional physicians and health plans in the United States. During the COVID-19 pandemic, chiropractic professional associations advised chiropractors to adhere to CDC, WHO, and local health department guidance. Despite these recommendations, a small but vocal and influential number of chiropractors spread vaccine misinformation.\n\n\n\nPage: Chiropractic controversy and criticism\nSummary: Throughout its history, chiropractic has been the subject of internal and external controversy and criticism.

While chiropractors hold a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree, they are not medical doctors. The primary treatment technique is manual therapy, often called spinal adjustment, and may also include exercises and lifestyle counseling.\n\nHistorically, some chiropractors believed that spinal manipulation could improve general health. However, there is no strong evidence to support the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation for many conditions, including lower back pain, and its safety is not fully established. Mild to moderate adverse effects are common, and serious complications, though rare, have been reported.\n\nChiropractic has been a subject of controversy throughout its history. It was founded by D.D. Palmer in the 1890s, who claimed to have received the knowledge from \"the other world.\" The practice is based on pseudoscientific ideas like vertebral subluxation and Innate Intelligence, which are at odds with evidence-based medicine. The American Medical Association even labeled it an \"unscientific cult\" in 1966, though it later gained more acceptance.

Elias experiences early successes, building a loyal patient base who feel abandoned by conventional medicine.\n*   **Rising conflict:** The medical establishment, represented by a skeptical but well-meaning doctor (e.g., Dr. Eleanor Vance), publicly dismisses chiropractic as an \"unscientific cult,\" leading to legal challenges and social ostracization for Elias and his peers. Elias, however, remains steadfast in his conviction.\n\n**Act 2: A Crisis of Faith and Scientific Awakening**\n*   **A pivotal case:** Elias takes on a complex patient (e.g., a child with a severe, non-musculoskeletal condition) whose health deteriorates despite his most fervent \"adjustments\" and reliance on \"Innate Intelligence.\" This failure deeply shakes Elias's core beliefs.\n*   **Internal and external conflict:** Elias begins to secretly research anatomy, physiology, and evidence-based practices, questioning the pseudoscientific tenets of his training. This leads to clashes with his dogmatic mentor and the traditional chiropractic leadership, who accuse him of betrayal.\n*   **Seeking new knowledge:** Elias cautiously reaches out to Dr. Vance, initially for medical records, leading to a tense but intellectually stimulating exchange. He starts to integrate exercises, lifestyle advice, and a more focused, musculoskeletal approach into his practice, alienating some traditional patients but gaining new ones.\n\n**Act 3: Forging Legitimacy**\n*   **The ultimate test:** Elias's refined, more evidence-based approach is put to the test with a high-stakes case – perhaps a patient with chronic, debilitating back pain who has found no relief elsewhere. He must prove his methods are effective and safe, not just anecdotal.\n*   **Confrontation and advocacy:** Elias publicly advocates for a more scientific and responsible chiropractic practice, challenging the old guard within his profession and seeking dialogue with the medical community. This could culminate in a public hearing or a pivotal presentation.\n*   **Resolution:** Elias doesn't achieve universal acceptance overnight, but his dedication to genuine healing and his willingness to evolve his practice earns him respect. He establishes a legitimate clinic that bridges the gap between alternative and conventional care, inspiring a new generation of chiropractors to pursue evidence-based practices, even as the broader debate continues. The film ends with a sense of progress and the ongoing journey towards integration and understanding.",
