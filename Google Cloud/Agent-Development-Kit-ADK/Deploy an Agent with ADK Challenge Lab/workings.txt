Deploy an Agent with ADK Challenge Lab
- Author agents using Agent Development Kit (ADK), 
- deploy those agents to Agent Engine, and
- use them from a web app



Objective
In this lab you will:
- Build an agent with Agent Development Kit (ADK) made up of a ROOT agent and SUB-agents
- Enable agents with a Vertex AI Search tool and custom function tools
- Store agent output in SESSION STATE and retrieve values from session state for subsequent agent instructions
- DEPLOY your agent to Agent Engine
- QUERY the agent deployed to Agent Engine









Challenge Scenario
Cymbal Shops is an American retail chain headquartered in Minneapolis that sells housewares, electronics, and clothing.

Cymbal Shops has expanded into Europe and launched a new Paint Department. It plans to use its new online presence to streamline the way people shop for paint for DIY home renovation projects.

A coworker of yours began to develop an agent, Paint Agent, to help the user:
- SELECT a PAINT product based on Cymbal Sheets' paint product datasheets
- choose a COLOUR from the selected product line
- determine HOW MUCH paint is needed by rooms' dimensions
- calculate the PRICE based on the selected options

Your coworker, however, got stuck on a bug and left the organization.
You are a new ML Engineer with Cymbal Shops. You've been tasked with completing the deployment of Paint Agent.






=================


Task 1. Install ADK and set up your environment



In this lab environment, the Vertex AI API has been enabled for you. If you were to follow these steps in your own project, you would enable it by navigating to Vertex AI and following the prompt to enable it.



Prepare a Cloud Shell Editor tab
With your Google Cloud console window selected, open Cloud Shell by pressing the G key and then the S key on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can click the Activate Cloud Shell button (Activate Cloud Shell) in the upper right of the Cloud console.

Click Continue.

When prompted to authorize Cloud Shell, click Authorize.

In the upper right corner of the Cloud Shell Terminal panel, click the Open in new window button Open in new window button.

In the Cloud Shell Terminal, enter the following to open the Cloud Shell Editor to your home directory:
```
cloudshell workspace ~
```
Close any additional tutorial or Gemini panels that appear on the right side of the screen to save more of your window for your code editor.

Throughout the rest of this lab, you can work in this window as your IDE with the Cloud Shell Editor and Cloud Shell Terminal.







Download and install ADK and code samples for this lab
Paste the following command into the Cloud Shell Terminal to copy files from a Cloud Storage bucket, creating a project directory with code for this lab:
```
gcloud storage cp -r gs://qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2-bucket/adk_challenge_lab .
```
Update your PATH environment variable and install ADK and other lab requirements by running the following commands in the Cloud Shell Terminal.
```
export PATH=$PATH:"/home/${USER}/.local/bin"
python3 -m pip install "google-adk==1.16.0" -r adk_challenge_lab/requirements.txt
```



student_01_fcaf8c44c469@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2)$ echo $PATH
/opt/gradle/bin:/opt/maven/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/node_packages/node_modules/.bin:/usr/local/rvm/bin:/home/student_01_fcaf8c44c469/.gems/bin:/usr/local/rvm/bin:/home/student_01_fcaf8c44c469/gopath/bin:/google/gopath/bin:/google/flutter/bin:/usr/local/nvm/versions/node/v24.11.1/bin:/home/student_01_fcaf8c44c469/.local/bin







=================



Task 2. Create an AI Applications search app for paint product info



The paint datasheet has not yet been uploaded for your agent to search.

Deploy an AI Applications data store. This data store will import a datasheet describing Cymbal Shops' paint (which you can preview in a tab in your Incognito window at https://storage.cloud.google.com/qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2-bucket/Cymbal_Shops_Paint_Datasheets.pdf). This datasheet will serve as the grounding data source for user queries about your paints.







Create an AI Applications data store with the following configuration:
Field		Value
Data source	Cloud Storage
Data type	Unstructured documents
Folder or File	File
File to import	qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2-bucket/Cymbal_Shops_Paint_Datasheets.pdf
Location	global
Data store name	Cymbal Paint
Document parser	Layout Parser
Enable table annotation	Enabled
Include ancestor headings in chunks	Enabled


Create an AI Applications search app with the following configuration:
Field		Value
App type	Custom search (general)
App name	Paint Search
Company name	Cymbal Shops
Location	global
Data store	Cymbal Paint





Copy the following commands to a text file and update the YOUR_ID value provided to the key SEARCH_ENGINE_ID to the ID of the search engine you just created (in the form paint-search_1756...):
```
cd ~/adk_challenge_lab
cat << EOF > .env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
RESOURCES_BUCKET=qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2-bucket
MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=YOUR_ID
EOF
```



```
cd ~/adk_challenge_lab
cat << EOF > .env
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
RESOURCES_BUCKET=qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2-bucket
MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=paint-search_1764641328925
EOF
```



Run your edited commands in the Cloud Shell Terminal to create a .env file with model authentication and configuration variables. [Note: To view a hidden file (indicated by a file beginning with a period), you can use the Cloud Shell Editor menus to enable View > Toggle Hidden Files]

Copy the .env file to the agent directory to provide your agent necessary authentication configurations once it is deployed:
```
cp .env paint_agent/.env

```




=================



Task 3. Debug the Paint Agent



A coworker of yours had begun work on the Paint Agent, but got stuck. You'll need to pick up where they left off -- including fixing a bug they left behind -- to complete and deploy the agent.

In the Cloud Shell Terminal, run the current version of the agent with:
```
adk run paint_agent
```
When the [user]: prompt appears, enter:
```
hello
```
If the agent follows up asking if you'd like to learn more about Cymbal Shops' paints, reply:
```
yes
```

Open the file adk_challenge_lab/paint_agent/agent.py and inspect the lists of sub-agents and tools that the root_agent utilizes. 
Notice that it includes sub-agents.
Even if there were no other tools, if the agent includes sub-agents and a search tool, this error would still be seen, as transferring to sub-agents invokes an implicit transfer_to_agent tool.
https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/tools/transfer_to_agent_tool.py






The root_agent's tool 'set_session_value' is not a search tool, so at least one of the sub-agents must invoke a search tool. 
Explore the sub-agents found in the sub_agents directory to find the search tool being used (in this case a VertexAiSearchTool):
https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/tools/vertex_ai_search_tool.py

Which sub-agent uses the VertexAiSearchTool?
room_planner
YES		search_agent
paint_searcher
coverage_agent






While a search tool cannot be combined with other non-search tools in an agent (even by using it in a sub-agent as seen here), ADK does provide a tool named AgentTool that can WRAP an isolated agent that uses a SEARCH TOOL. Then that agent-as-tool can be used with other tools.

Back in the root_agent's file adk_challenge_lab/paint_agent/agent.py, add an AgentTool() to the root_agent's list of tools.

Provide the AgentTool() the following arguments:
- agent should be set to the sub-agent that uses the search tool you uncovered above.
- skip_summarization should be set to False because you would like the agent to report on what the search tool has returned.

Remove that sub-agent from the sub_agents list.
Save the file.






Note: Continue only after your data store has been created and your document indexed. You can monitor this status in the AI Applications > Data Stores > Cymbal Paint data store on the Documents tab.

In the Cloud Shell Terminal, run the agent again with:
```
adk run paint_agent
```
You should now be able to chat with the agent and get information on Cymbal Shops paint.

Get the agent to tell you the price of the EcoGreens and Forever Paint paints.

When you are finished chatting with the agent via the command-line interface, type exit to end the conversation.

Task 4. Save and utilize shared state



Your root_agent imports and uses a set_session_value tool from adk_challenge_lab/paint_agent/tools.py, but it is not fully implemented.

Update the set_session_value function in the file adk_challenge_lab/paint_agent/tools.py to store key-value pairs in the ToolContext's state dictionary.

Update the function's response to return a status message of f"stored '{value}' in '{key}'".

```
# b4
# def set_session_value(tool_context: ToolContext, key: str, value: str):
#     """Sets a value in the tool_context's state dictionary."""

#     return {"status": "tool not implemented"}

# aft
def set_session_value(tool_context: ToolContext, key: str, value: str):
    """Sets a value in the tool_context's state dictionary."""

    tool_context.state[key] = value
    return {"status": f"stored '{value}' in '{key}'"}
```






Open the agent.py file associated with the coverage_calculator_agent (sub-agent of the room_planner, which is a sub-agent of your root_agent).

Notice that its instructions are not correctly loading values from the state dictionary. Update the instruction to replace terms in ALL CAPS to instead use ADK's key templating to load state values into instructions.
https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/state/#using-key-templating
```
{ COVERAGE_RATE? }
```






Test your agent with:
```
adk web
```
Select paint_agent.

You should now be able to have the following conversation with your agent:

You	Agent Response
hello	[Offers to share information about Cymbal Shops' paints]

Task 5. Deploy to Agent Engine



In Cloud Shell Terminal, make sure you are in the adk_challenge_lab directory:
```
cd ~/adk_challenge_lab
```


Deploy your agent with the appropriate deployment command to deploy the paint_agent to Agent Engine, using the following arguments:

Parameter	Argument
--display_name	"Paint Agent"
--staging_bucket	gs://qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2-bucket



student
```
adk deploy agent_engine paint_agent \
--display_name "Paint Agent" \
--staging_bucket gs://qwiklabs-gcp-03-2534148fb0a2-bucket
```









As the agent deploys, grant the Vertex AI User and Discovery Engine User IAM roles to the Vertex AI Reasoning Engine Service Agent



Principal	service-32470114406@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Name		AI Platform Reasoning Engine Service Agent 	
Role		Discovery Engine User
		Vertex AI Reasoning Engine Service Agent
		Vertex AI User
