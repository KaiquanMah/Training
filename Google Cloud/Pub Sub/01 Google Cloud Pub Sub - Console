Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service for exchanging event data among applications and services. 
A producer of data publishes messages to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. 
A consumer creates a subscription to that topic. 
Subscribers either pull messages from a subscription or are configured as webhooks for push subscriptions. 
Every subscriber must acknowledge each message within a configurable window of time.
