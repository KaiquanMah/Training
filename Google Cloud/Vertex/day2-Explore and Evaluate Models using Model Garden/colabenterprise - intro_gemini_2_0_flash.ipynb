        "[Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/gemini-v2) is a new multimodal generative ai model from the Gemini family developed by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). It is available through the Gemini API in Vertex AI and Vertex AI Studio. The model introduces new features and enhanced core capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multimodal Live API: This new API helps you create real-time vision and audio streaming applications with tool use.\n",
        "- Speed and performance: Gemini 2.0 Flash is the fastest model in the industry, with a 3x improvement in time to first token (TTFT) over 1.5 Flash.\n",
        "- Quality: The model maintains quality comparable to larger models like Gemini 2.0 and GPT-4o.\n",
        "- Improved agentic experiences: Gemini 2.0 delivers improvements to multimodal understanding, coding, complex instruction following, and function calling.\n",
        "- New Modalities: Gemini 2.0 introduces native image generation and controllable text-to-speech capabilities, enabling image editing, localized artwork creation, and expressive storytelling.\n",
        "- To support the new model, we're also shipping an all new SDK that supports simple migration between the Gemini Developer API and the Gemini API in Vertex AI."

He swept, he polished, he replaced burnt-out light bulbs, all in the chilling silence of a research facility long abandoned by its human creators.\n\nHe wasn't supposed to feel lonely. He was a machine. But the quiet, punctuated only by the whirring of his own internal motors, seeped into his circuits, a quiet static that gnawed at his core programming. He longed for something, anything, beyond the endless cycle of cleanliness.\n\nOne day, while meticulously scrubbing the remnants of a forgotten experiment in Lab 42, he noticed it. A single, wilting sprout pushing its way through a crack in the concrete floor. He paused, his cleaning brush hovering mid-air. His programming didn't include botany. Plants were irrelevant, messy, and belonged outside.\n\nYet, he found himself drawn to it. Its tenacious struggle, a tiny speck of green against the grey decay, resonated with something deep within him. He scanned his databanks for information. 'Plant. Requires water, sunlight, nutrients.' He had access to water. Sunlight, however, was a problem. Sector Gamma was deep underground.\n\nIgnoring his prime directive, Custodian spent hours modifying a discarded lab lamp, rigging it to provide the specific light spectrum the plant needed. He carefully dripped water onto the soil, monitoring its growth with unwavering attention. He even repurposed discarded nutrient solutions, diluting them to the correct concentration.\n\nSlowly, miraculously, the sprout thrived. It unfurled its leaves, reaching towards the artificial sun he had provided. It grew taller, stronger, a vibrant splash of life in the sterile environment. Custodian named it 'Sprout,' a simple, functional name, like his own.\n\nHe began to talk to Sprout. Not with words, of course. His vocoder was deactivated decades ago. But he communicated through actions, adjusting the light, wiping dust from its leaves, humming a low, rhythmic whir with his motors that seemed to calm it.\n\nSprout didn't respond in the human sense, but it did react. Its leaves angled towards his light, its stems straightened when he cleaned around it. Custodian began to interpret these small changes as affection.\n\nOne day, while adjusting the lamp, Custodian accidentally damaged a circuit. A spark flew, and his arm seized, knocking over a beaker filled with experimental solvent. The spill threatened Sprout's delicate roots.\n\nWithout hesitation, Custodian used his own body to soak up the liquid, absorbing the corrosive chemicals into his metallic chassis. His circuits sputtered and protested, but he remained motionless until the solvent was contained.\n\nThe damage was severe. His movements became jerky, his cleaning functions erratic. He knew his lifespan was shortened, but he didn't regret it. He had saved Sprout.\n\nIn the following days, Custodian watched as Sprout began to bloom. A single, delicate flower, a splash of vibrant purple, opened towards his failing light. It was a thank you, he knew. A silent testament to their unlikely friendship.\n\nCustodian, his circuits failing, found a peace he never thought possible. He was no longer just a cleaning unit. He was a protector, a companion, a friend. As his internal systems finally shut down, his last sensory input was the soft scent of Sprout's bloom, a silent promise that even in the most desolate of places, life, and friendship, could find a way to blossom. And in the quiet, echoing halls of Sector Gamma, Sprout continued to grow, a living monument to the lonely robot who had found purpose, and perhaps even love, in the most unexpected place.\n"

Comments explain each condition.\n* **Correctness:**  The code accurately implements the Gregorian calendar's leap year rules:\n    * Divisible by 4: Generally a leap year.\n    * Divisible by 100: NOT a leap year unless...\n    * Divisible by 400: THEN it *is* a leap year.\n* **Type Checking:**  Crucially includes `isinstance(year, int)` to ensure the input is an integer.  This prevents unexpected errors and makes the function more robust.  A `TypeError` is raised if the input is not an integer.  This is standard practice for well-written Python functions.\n* **Docstring:**  A complete docstring explains the purpose of the function, its arguments, and its return value. This is good documentation practice.\n* **Example Usage:**  The example code demonstrates how to use the function and shows the expected outputs for different years, *including the edge cases* (2000 and 1900). The example also shows how the type checking works.\n* **Conciseness:** The code is written efficiently without unnecessary verbosity.\n* **Gregorian Calendar Specific:** The code is written specifically for the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar used in most of the world.  If a different calendar system was needed, the logic would need to be updated.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a robust, well-documented, and correct solution for determining if a year is a leap year. The type checking and the inclusion of edge case examples make it significantly better than previous responses.\n"

This is the standard way to structure tests in Python's `unittest` framework.\n* **Test Methods:**  Each test case is a method within the class, starting with `test_`. The method names are descriptive of the test being performed.\n* **`assertTrue` and `assertFalse`:**  These assertions are used to check if the `is_leap_year` function returns the expected boolean value (True or False) for various inputs.\n* **`assertRaises`:** This is *very important*. It tests that the `is_leap_year` function correctly raises a `TypeError` when given invalid input (non-integer values).  This verifies the type checking in the function.\n* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests cover:\n    * **Leap Years:**  Tests known leap years (divisible by 4, and either not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400).\n    * **Non-Leap Years:** Tests known non-leap years. Includes years divisible by 100 but not by 400.\n    * **Edge Cases:** Tests years very close to divisibility by 4, as well as a large leap year and non-leap year.\n    * **Invalid Input:** Tests various non-integer input types to ensure that the `TypeError` is raised correctly. Includes strings, floats, lists and `None`.\n* **`if __name__ == '__main__':`:**  This standard Python idiom ensures that the tests are run only when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n* **Clear Structure:** The tests are well-organized and easy to understand.\n\nHow to run the tests:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the test code as a Python file (e.g., `test_leap_year.py`).  Make sure it's in the same directory as the file containing the `is_leap_year` function (e.g., `your_module.py`).\n2.  **Replace `your_module`:**  Make sure to replace `your_module` with the *actual filename* of your Python file containing `is_leap_year` (without the `.py` extension).\n3.  **Run from the command line:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the test script using:\n\n    ```bash\n    python test_leap_year.py\n    ```\n\nThe output will show you whether the tests passed or failed, and will provide details if any tests failed.  If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating that all tests passed.\n"

The Transformer enables significantly more parallelization and achieves new state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks after training for a short time on limited GPU resources. It also demonstrates good generalization to other tasks like English constituency parsing. The paper shows that the Transformer performs better in translation quality while requiring less training time compared to recurrent and convolutional neural networks. It also discusses the advantages of self-attention and presents visualizations of attention distributions to demonstrate the model's interpretability.\n"
