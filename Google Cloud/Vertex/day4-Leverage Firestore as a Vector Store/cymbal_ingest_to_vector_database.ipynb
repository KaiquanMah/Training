Among the rules embodied in the Health Code is Article 81 which regulates the operations of food establishments for the purpose of preventing public health hazards. Environmental Health Division  The Division of Environmental Health is the Commission within the Health Department that is concerned with public health and works to eliminate the incidence of injury and illness caused by environmental factors. There are several Offices and Bureaus within this division. One of these is the Bureau of Food Safety and Community Sanitation that has the responsibility for conducting inspections of food service and food processing establishments. These inspections are performed by Public Health Sanitarians. Anti-corruption Warning All Sanitarians have Department of Health and Mental Hygiene badges and identification cards which they must display whenever it is requested of them. It is illegal to offer a Sanitarian any bribe, gratuity or reward for official misconduct; this is a crime that can result in fines, and /or imprisonment, and the revocation of permits. Also, Sanitarians are not authorized to conduct any monetary transactions on behalf of the Department. Inspector General This is an office that exists within the Health Department with the responsibility of investigating any incidence of alleged corrupt activity. Investigations may be conducted as a result of complaints by employees of the Department or members of the public. Health Academy The Health Academy is an office within the Division of Environmental Health. One of its responsibilities is to provide training and certification courses for individuals from the public as mandated by the Health Code. The Food Protection Course is one of the courses taught here. The Food Protection Course is required by the Health Code for supervisors of food service establishments and non-retail food processing establishments. These individuals must take the course and pass an examination before a certificate is issued to them. A person holding such a certificate must be on the premises and supervise all food preparation activities during all hours of operation. Several supervisors with this certification may be needed at an establishment to have coverage during all shifts, vacations or illnesses. The Food Protection Manual has been designed to assist participants of the course to better understand the principles of safe food handling. It serves as a reference for food service operators and it includes the necessary information to pass the final examination. On-Line Food Protection Course The Food Protection Course in English, Spanish and Chinese is now also available on-line. This course is designed for individuals with busy schedules to study at their convenience. After the completion of the course, a final examination is scheduled at the Health Academy.',\n",

The link is: nyc.gov/foodprotectioncourse Register for Health Academy Classes On-Line You may now register and pay online for courses offered at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Health Academy, including the Food Protection Course for restaurants. This new service allows you to avoid going to the Citywide Licensing Center to register for a course. You may also use the on-line service to pay for and request an appointment to replace your Food Protection Certificate. How does it work? Go to the registration web page, nyc.gov/healthacademy, select a course and date, pay the appropriate fee and receive confirmation. You will be asked to provide some personal information before registering. In most cases, you will be able to select from a list of course dates.',\n",

              " 'The United States has one of the safest food safety systems in the world, yet millions of Americans still get sick each year from eating contaminated foods; hundreds of thousands are hospitalized; and several thousand die. This means that there is still tremendous room for improvement in food safety standards. Most food-borne illnesses are caused by improper handling of food. The statistics from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) show that some of the most common causes of foodborne illness are:  Sick food worker  Poor personal Hygiene/Bare hand contact  Improper holding temperatures  Improper cooling  Inadequate cooking and reheating  Cross contamination  Use of food from unknown source What is Food-Borne Illness? Any illness that is caused by food is called food-borne illness. A foodborne illness outbreak is defined as any incident involving two or more persons becoming ill with similar symptoms from the same source. Typically these illnesses are a direct result of contamination of food by harmful microorganisms, (commonly called germs) such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi etc. Injury and illness caused by foreign objects, dangerous chemicals and/or allergens in food is also considered a foodborne illness. Who is at Risk? We are all at risk of getting a food borne illness; however, the effects are more severe for certain categories of individuals:  Children whose immune system (human body’s defense system against diseases) is not fully developed yet. Elderly individuals because their immune system is not robust anymore and has weakened due to old age. Pregnant women where the threat is both to the mother and the fetus. Individuals with compromised immune systems e.g., Patients with AIDS, cancer  or individuals who are diabetics, etc. People on medication (antibiotics, immunosuppressant, etc.). What is food?',\n",
              " 'Food is any edible substance, ice, beverage, or ingredient intended for use and used or sold for human consumption. What are Potentially Hazardous Foods (PHF)? This expression refers to those foods that provide suitable conditions for rapid growth of microorganisms. These include foods that are high in protein like raw or cooked animal products such as meats, poultry, fish, shellfish (mollusks as well as crustaceans), milk and milk products (cheese, butter milk, heavy cream etc.,), plant protein such as tofu, and starches such as cooked rice, cooked pasta, cooked beans and cooked vegetables like potatoes, cut melons, cut leafy greens, cut tomatoes or mixtures of cut tomatoes, as well as raw seed sprouts and garlic in oil. Exceptions: Those foods that have a low water activity (.85 or less) or those that are highly acidic with a pH of 4.6 or below.

In this way the frozen item will defrost but will not go above 41°F. 2) Frozen foods may be submerged under water with the cold water faucet open and the water running continuously so that any loose particles may float and run off. 3) Frozen foods may be thawed in a microwave oven but this may only be done if: \u0002 After thawing, the food item is removed immediately for cooking in the regular oven or stove. \u0002 The entire cooking process takes place without interruption in the microwave oven.

Do not forget to replace the ice as it melts away. \u0002 You may apply ice directly into food as an ingredient. Thick soups and gravies may be cooled down rapidly by adding ice directly into the food. \u0002 Use a Rapid Chill unit or a Blast chiller.  \u0002 Insert an ice paddle into food and stir. \u0002 You may combine methods above, e.g., cut foods into small pieces and place in shallow pans in an ice-water bath. \u0002 Metal containers such a stainless steel or aluminum are great conductors of heat. Use metal containers for all cooling operations. Reheating The Health Code requires that potentially hazardous food that is cooked, cooled and reheated for hot holding must be reheated to 165°F or above for 15 seconds within two hours and held at 140°F or above until served. This procedure destroys the bacteria that cause food poisoning and prevents them from growing in\n",

Due to uneven cooking process in the microwave ovens, add 25°F to the final cooking temperature to ensure thorough cooking.  Hot Holding Once food is cooked, if not served immediately, it must be held at the proper temperature. Potentially hazardous food (PHF) that have just finished the cooking process or that have just been reheated must either be served immediately or held hot for future service. These foods must be held constantly at 140°F or higher. Failure to hold such foods at the adequate temperature will result in the growth of bacteria. This common error results in many cases of food borne illness each year.  A hot holding unit must be used to hot hold potentially hazardous foods properly. This unit must hold foods at 140°F or higher. Care and constant monitoring are required to ensure that foods do not fall below 140°F. These foods should never be stored\n",

            "**Steps:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Prepare the Dumplings and Container:**\n",
            "    *   Place the thawed chicken dumplings evenly in your microwaveable container. Do not overcrowd them.\n",
            "    *   (Optional but recommended for moisture and initial cooking) Add a small amount of water or broth to the container, enough to cover the bottom but not fully submerge the dumplings yet.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Initial Heating with Boiled Water:**\n",
            "    *   Boil water in your kettle until it reaches **100°C**.\n",
            "    *   Carefully pour the freshly boiled water over the dumplings in the microwaveable container, ensuring they are mostly submerged. The hot water will begin to cook them from the outside in.\n",
            "    *   Cover the container (with a microwave-safe lid or plastic wrap, leaving a small vent if using plastic wrap). Let them stand in the hot water for **3-5 minutes** to allow initial heat penetration. This helps reduce the \"cold spots\" risk later in the microwave.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Microwave Cooking for Thoroughness:**\n",
            "    *   After the initial soak, carefully drain most of the water from the container, leaving a small amount (e.g., 1-2 tablespoons) if desired for steam.\n",
            "    *   Cover the container again (as per text: \"Arrange food items evenly and cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap; the moist heat will help destroy harmful bacteria and ensure uniform cooking\").\n",
            "    *   Place the covered container in the microwave.\n",
            "    *   **Microwave Process:**\n",
            "        *   Cook on **medium power** initially, especially if the dumplings are thick or numerous (as the text advises: \"When cooking large cuts of meats, adjust the settings to medium power, and cook for longer periods of time\"). This allows for more even cooking.\n",
            "        *   **Stir or rotate** the dumplings halfway through the cooking process. This is crucial for safety as the text states: \"Stir or rotate food halfway through the process to eliminate cold spots where harmful bacteria can survive, and for more even cooking.\"\n",
            "        *   Continue cooking until they appear cooked through.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Standing Time:**\n",
            "    *   Once cooking is complete, remove the container from the microwave.\n",
            "    *   **\"Let food stand for at least two minutes after microwaving to allow even distribution of heat throughout the product.\"** This standing time is critical for the heat to equalize.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Verify Internal Temperature (Crucial Safety Step):**\n",
            "    *   Using a food thermometer, check the internal temperature of several dumplings, especially those in the center and any that seem less cooked.\n",
            "    *   As per the text's guideline for microwave cooking (\"add 25°F to the final cooking temperature\"), the internal temperature of the chicken dumplings **must reach at least 190°F (approximately 88°C)**.\n",
            "    *   If the temperature is not met, return the dumplings to the microwave and cook for additional short intervals, stirring and re-checking, until the target temperature is reached.\n",
