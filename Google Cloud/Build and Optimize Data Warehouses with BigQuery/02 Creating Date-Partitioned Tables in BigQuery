Overview
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.
In this lab, you learn how to query and create partitioned tables in BigQuery to improve query performance and reduce resource usage. The data for this lab is an ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery.


What you'll do
In this lab, you learn how to:
Query partitioned tables.
Create your own partitioned tables.







Open the BigQuery console
In the Google Cloud Console, select Navigation menu > BigQuery.
The Welcome to BigQuery in the Cloud Console message box opens. This message box provides a link to the quickstart guide and the release notes.
Click Done.
The BigQuery console opens.














=================================




Task 1. Create a new dataset
First, you will create a dataset to store your tables.
In the Explorer pane, near your project id, click on View actions then click Create dataset.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/AP%2B7ysu%2FJbFGYOu09hM81NdW5uLDPvqskkHZJyq%2BQrY%3D

Set Dataset ID to ecommerce.
Leave the other options at their default values (Data Location, Default table Expiration).

Click Create dataset.






















=================================






Task 2. Create tables with date partitions
A partitioned table is a table that is divided into segments, called partitions, that make it easier to manage and query your data. By dividing a large table into smaller partitions, you can improve query performance, and control costs by reducing the number of bytes read by a query.
Now create a new table and bind a date or timestamp column as a partition. Before we do that, let's explore the data in the non-partitioned table first.





Query web page analytics for a sample of visitors in 2017
Click on + Compose new query and add the below query:
#standardSQL
SELECT DISTINCT
  fullVisitorId,
  date,
  city,
  pageTitle
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
WHERE date = '20170708'
LIMIT 5



Before running, note the total amount of data it will process as indicated next to the query validator icon: "This query will process 1.74 GB when run".
Click Run.
The query returns 5 results.








Query web page analytics for a sample of visitors in 2018
Let's modify the query to look at visitors for 2018 now.
Click COMPOSE NEW QUERY to clear the Query Editor, then add this new query. Note the WHERE date parameter is changed to 20180708:
#standardSQL
SELECT DISTINCT
  fullVisitorId,
  date,
  city,
  pageTitle
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
WHERE date = '20180708'
LIMIT 5



The Query Validator tells you how much data this query will process.
Click Run.
Notice that the query still processes 1.74 GB even though it returns 0 results. Why? The query engine needs to scan all records in the dataset to see if they satisfy the date matching condition in the WHERE clause. It must look at each record to compare the date against the condition of â€˜20180708'.
Additionally, the LIMIT 5 does not reduce the total amount of data processed, which is a common misconception.







Why did the previous query return 0 records but still scan through 1.74GB of data?
Before the query runs, the query engine does not know whether 2018 data exists to satisfy the WHERE clause condition and it needs to scan through all records in a non-partitioned table.
The query was written incorrectly
The query engine has the metadata for each partition stored but still needs to scan all records even if the table is partitioned.















Common use-cases for date-partitioned tables
Scanning through the entire dataset everytime to compare rows against a WHERE condition is wasteful. This is especially true if you only really care about records for a specific period of time like:
All transactions for the last year
All visitor interactions within the last 7 days
All products sold in the last month

Instead of scanning the entire dataset and filtering on a date field like we did in the earlier queries, Now set up a date-partitioned table. This allows you to completely ignore scanning records in certain partitions if they are irrelevant to our query.













Create a new partitioned table based on date

Click COMPOSE NEW QUERY , add the below query, then click Run:
#standardSQL
 CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.partition_by_day
 PARTITION BY date_formatted
 OPTIONS(
   description="a table partitioned by date"
 ) AS

 SELECT DISTINCT
 PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d", date) AS date_formatted,
 fullvisitorId
 FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`

In this query, note the new option - PARTITION BY a field. The two options available to partition are DATE and TIMESTAMP. The PARSE_DATE function is used on the date field (stored as a string) to get it into the proper DATE type for partitioning.



Click on the ecommerce dataset, then select the new partiton_by_day table:
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/MOKf1mKRDJjhlD0WxypQMvRsMV93A4PPOjC4aD%2BcpgM%3D




Click on the Details tab.
Confirm that you see:
Partitioned by: Day
Partitioning on: date_formatted
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/INxxScny5dVwKWvwsQ%2FZ8e80Ai4Wpxr2Ypiqmpq03Ts%3D
Note: Partitions within partitioned tables on your lab account will auto-expire after 60 days from the value in your date column. Your personal Google Cloud account with billing-enabled will let you have partitioned tables that don't expire. For the purposes of this lab, the remaining queries will be run against partitioned tables that have already been created.










=================================







Task 3. Review results from queries on a partitioned table
Run the below query, and note the total bytes to be processed:
#standardSQL
SELECT *
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.partition_by_day`
WHERE date_formatted = '2016-08-01'

This time 25 KB or 0.025MB is processed, which is a fraction of what you queried.




Now run the below query, and note the total bytes to be processed:
#standardSQL
SELECT *
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.partition_by_day`
WHERE date_formatted = '2018-07-08'

You should see This query will process 0 B when run.










Why was there 0 bytes processed?
The query engine knows which date partitions exist before the query is ran (and there is no 2018 partitions)
The query is running from a saved View
The query is running from query cache










=================================







Task 4. Create an auto-expiring partitioned table
Auto-expiring partitioned tables are used to comply with data privacy statutes, and can be used to avoid unnecessary storage (which you'll be charged for in a production environment). If you want to create a rolling window of data, add an expiration date so the partition disappears after you're finished using it.



Explore the available NOAA weather data tables
In the left menu, in Explorer, click on + Add and select Public datasets.
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/%2F29Pylwxd7gk1LWdiOg5S9COjDSCdcVA4FArFJIcswE%3D
Search for GSOD NOAA then select the dataset.
Click on View Dataset.
Scroll through the tables in the noaa_gsod dataset (which are manually sharded and not partitioned):
https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/LJhLVqXD9KS90oAAMyHh%2FeasHL7ZEdxROIYpVvAD83g%3D



Your goal is to create a table that:
Queries on weather data from 2018 onward
Filters to only include days that have had some precipitation (rain, snow, etc.)
Only stores each partition of data for 90 days from that partition's date (rolling window)



First, copy and paste this below query:
#standardSQL
 SELECT
   DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,
   (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
    WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names
   prcp
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
 WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
   AND prcp > 0      -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation
   AND _TABLE_SUFFIX >= '2018'
 ORDER BY date DESC -- Where has it rained/snowed recently
 LIMIT 10



Note: The table wildcard * used in the FROM clause to limit the amount of tables referred to in the TABLE_SUFFIX filter.
Note: Although a LIMIT 10 was added, this still does not reduce the total amount of data scanned (about 1.83 GB) since there are no partitions yet.
Click Run.
Confirm the date is properly formatted and the precipitation field is showing non-zero values.




















=================================







Task 5. Your turn: create a partitioned table

Modify the previous query to create a table with the below specifications:
Table name: ecommerce.days_with_rain
Use the date field as your PARTITION BY
For OPTIONS, specify partition_expiration_days = 60
Add the table description = "weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day"



Your query should look like this:
#standardSQL
 CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.days_with_rain
 PARTITION BY date
 OPTIONS (
   partition_expiration_days=60,
   description="weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day"
 ) AS


 SELECT
   DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,
   (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
    WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names
   prcp
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
 WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
   AND prcp > 0      -- Filter
   AND _TABLE_SUFFIX >= '2018'












Confirm data partition expiration is working
To confirm you are only storing data from 60 days in the past up until today, run the DATE_DIFF query to get the age of your partitions, which are set to expire after 60 days.
Below is a query which tracks the average rainfall for the NOAA weather station in Wakayama, Japan which has significant precipitation.
Add this query and run it:
#standardSQL
# avg monthly precipitation
SELECT
  AVG(prcp) AS average,
  station_name,
  date,
  CURRENT_DATE() AS today,
  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), date, DAY) AS partition_age,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month
FROM ecommerce.days_with_rain
WHERE station_name = 'WAKAYAMA' #Japan
GROUP BY station_name, date, today, month, partition_age
ORDER BY date DESC; # most recent days first









=================================







Task 6. Confirm the oldest partition_age is at or below 60 days
Update the ORDER BY clause to show the oldest partitions first.
Add this query and run it:
#standardSQL
# avg monthly precipitation

SELECT
  AVG(prcp) AS average,
  station_name,
  date,
  CURRENT_DATE() AS today,
  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), date, DAY) AS partition_age,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month
FROM ecommerce.days_with_rain
WHERE station_name = 'WAKAYAMA' #Japan
GROUP BY station_name, date, today, month, partition_age
ORDER BY partition_age DESC




Note: Your results will vary if you re-run the query in the future, as the weather data, and your partitions, are continuously updated.
