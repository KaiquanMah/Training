Unix philosophy - operating system should provide simple tools that can be combined together to create sophisticated solutions
Unix utilities e.g. ls, grep, cat and awk


You have an existing bash script that you need to run in a hurry. This script was written by a coworker and audits the number of files in a directory. You need to integrate this into your existing data science project, but don't have time to change it. You remember that you can use %%bash magic syntax to capture the output of a script in IPython. What is the proper way to run this script?
An IPython script, script.ipy, has been provided for you to work in. You can run the script by running ipython script.ipy in the console.



script.ipy
%%bash --out output --err error
echo "Running Directory Audit Script"
CSV=`ls -l test_dir/*.csv | wc -l`
TXT=`ls -l test_dir/*.csv | wc -l`
echo 'The directory contains this a total # *.csv files: ' $CSV
echo 'The directory contains this a total # *.txt files: ' $TXT









shell
repl:~/workspace$ ipython script.ipy



Correct! %%bash --out output will allow you to run a code block with output stored in the variable output. 
Being able to run a full bash script in Jupyter notebooks or IPython can be very helpful. 
One good use case is needing to download machine learning training data using wget, then uncompressing it.
