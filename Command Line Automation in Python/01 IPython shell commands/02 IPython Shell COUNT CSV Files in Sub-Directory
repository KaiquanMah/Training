One of your coworkers has mentioned that you can do very powerful shell operations inside of the IPython terminal. You decide to try this out to solve a problem you are currently working on. You use this approach to see if you can determine how many files of a specific type live in a directory by using this along with the built-in len() method. The output of !ls will return a list which you can store as a variable.
An IPython script, script.ipy, has been provided for you to work in. You can run the script by running ipython script.ipy in the console.


Navigate to the test_dir directory and check how many total files have the extension .csv. Store the results of command to the variable var.
Run len() on var to print the number of .csv files that live in the directory.




#script.ipy
var = !ls -h test_dir/*.csv
print(len(var))



#v1 = !ls -h subDir/*.csv
#len(v1)







#shell
repl:~/workspace$ pwd
/home/repl/workspace
repl:~/workspace$ ls
script.ipy  test_dir

#move to the sub directory
#check the file patterns
repl:~/workspace$ cd test_dir/
repl:~/workspace/test_dir$ ls
file_0.csv  file_1.txt  file_2.csv  file_3.txt  file_4.csv  file_5.txt  file_6.csv  file_7.txt  file_8.csv  file_9.txt

#once you checked the file patterns
#move back to the parent directory
repl:~/workspace/test_dir$ cd ..
repl:~/workspace$ ipython script.ipy

You are on your way to mastering an important automation tool in IPython. 
You can use !ls */*.csv to find the number of csv files. 
If you store as a variable, you can then use: len(var) to get the count.
