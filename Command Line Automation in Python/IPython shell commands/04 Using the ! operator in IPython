You have a directory full of files you want the size of and need a technique that will allow you to filter patterns.
To accomplish this task, you'll be using the awk command. Awk is a tool that is used often on the Unix command line because it understands how to deal with whitespace delimited output from shell commands. The awk command works well at grabbing fields from a string.
An IPython script, script.ipy, has been provided for you to work in. You can run the script by running ipython script.ipy in the console.


Use the ! operator to create a command that sums the total size of the files in a directory.
Make sure you pipe a command into awk using the | operator.



!ls -l | awk '{SUM+=$5} END {print SUM}' -> sums values in col 5, then print SUM
script.ipy
!ls -l | awk '{SUM+=$5} END {print SUM}'


shell
repl:~/workspace$ ipython script.ipy
4137


Correct! You can use ls -l | awk '{ SUM+=$5} END {print SUM}' to sum the file sizes. 
Being able to do a little bit of Unix piping will make you stand out in your career. Great work!












!ls -l -> shows files and folders, size, date, time
script.ipy
!ls -l

shell
repl:~/workspace$ ipython script.ipy
total 8
-rwxr-xr-x 1 repl repl    8 Jul 15 13:45 script.ipy
drwxr-xr-x 2 repl repl 4096 Jul 15 13:43 test_dir









!ls -> shows files and folders in the directory
script.ipy
!ls

repl:~/workspace$ ipython script.ipy
script.ipy  test_dir
