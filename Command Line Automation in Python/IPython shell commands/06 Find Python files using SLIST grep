A coworker has written a script that has gone haywire. You both have been working in a directory src and this is where you store your python scripts. Your coworker accidentally wrote 250 text files that have similar names to your python files. Help clean up the mess by using the SList .grep() method to filter for files only containing the pattern .py.
An IPython script, script.ipy, has been provided for you to work in. You can run the script by running ipython script.ipy in the console.


Store the list of files in the src directory to the res object.
Use the .grep() method on res to find the names of the Python source code files in the src directory.

Did you store the output of !ls src?
Remember the .grep() method will accept a file extension like .grep(".txt").
If you get stuck on remembering how to use an SList type you can ask for help: res.grep?. Assuming res is the variable you stored output to.

script.ipy
res = !ls src
print(res.grep(".py"))


shell
repl:~/workspace$ ipython script.ipy
['apple.py', 'banana.py', 'orange.py']


You can use ls.grep('.py') to filter only the python files.
