You get woken up in the middle of the night by a frantic phone call from a co-worker. There is a rogue process running in production that is generating hundreds of extra backup files. It was discovered when your co-worker tried to restore from backup, but found hundreds of backup files that are corrupt. You need to write a script to isolate the correct backup file.
Use the SList object to find all files with the number 2 in them and print out their full path so the backups can be inspected. The reason 2 is so important is this corresponds to the second day of the week Tuesday. This is the last time the backups worked properly.


Use the SList result object and the grep method to find all files with the pattern '_2' in them.
Iterate over the results of the SList query and create a full path to the file.
Print the full path to files matching this query.
