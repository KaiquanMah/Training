After escaping the oppressive rent of the Bay Area by moving to Texas, you got a job at a dude ranch as their only programmer. Once a year they sell all of their cattle in an auction. You wrote their inventory control system from scratch in Python and the CEO said, "Not bad for a kid from 'Frisco'". The day before the auction the CEO comes up to you in a panic because the names of all of the cattle are wrong in the inventory control system. The CEO tells you, "Y'all got some renaming to do!".
longhorn

Rename all of the files in the cattle directory by replacing the phrase 'shorthorn' with 'longhorn'. The os and pathlib modules have been imported for you. Remember that the name variable will need to be split to be renamed.
Use os.walk to traverse the cattle directory.
Use pathlib to rename all files with 'shorthorn' to 'longhorn'.





Typing who in IPython shows you the modules that are imported in a session.
Remember to split the name string using .split(_) to get the correct filename.







script.py
import pathlib
import os

# Walk the filesystem starting at the test_dir
for root, _, files in os.walk('cattle'):
    for name in files:
      	
        # Create the full path to the file by using os.path.join()
        fullpath = os.path.join(root, name)
        print(f"Processing file: {fullpath}")
        
        # Rename file
        if "shorthorn" in name:
            p = pathlib.Path(fullpath)
            shortname = name.split("_")[0] # You need to split the name by underscore
            new_name = f"{shortname}_longhorn"
            print(f"Renaming file {name} to {new_name}")
            p.rename(new_name)

You were able to rename an entire directory full of files using pathlib just in time for the auction. Apparently this isn't your first rodeo.
