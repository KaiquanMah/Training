As a Data Engineer at a Fortune 500 company you need to make sure your large scale data pipeline is running smoothly. Recently you have been experienced unpredictable errors when running Spark Python jobs. You want to write an integration test that programmatically creates Python files, gives them executable permission and the runs them. You want to run this everytime you create IaC (Infrastructure as Code) scripts that provision new Spark clusters.
Create an integration script that creates several Python files and writes Python to them. After that run them all with python3 and subprocess to obtain the scripts' output. The Path module is imported for you.


Use pathlib.write_text to write to create and write files.
Use Path and .glob to find these files.
Run all the matching python scripts using subprocess.run method.



script.py
from subprocess import run, PIPE
from pathlib import Path

# Find all the python files you created and print them out
for i in range(3):
    path = Path(f"/home/repl/workspace/test/file_{i}.py")
    path.write_text("#!/usr/bin/env python\n")
    path.write_text("import datetime;print(datetime.datetime.now())")
  

# Find all the python files you created and print them out
for file in Path("/home/repl/workspace/test/").glob("*.py"):
   # Gets the resolved full path
   fullpath = str(file.resolve())
   proc = run(["python3", fullpath], stdout=PIPE)
   print(proc)





shell
repl:~/workspace$ python3 script.py
CompletedProcess(args=['python3', '/home/repl/workspace/test/file_0.py'], returncode=0, stdout=b'2021-07-16 10:14:38.452496\n')
CompletedProcess(args=['python3', '/home/repl/workspace/test/file_2.py'], returncode=0, stdout=b'2021-07-16 10:14:38.478108\n')
CompletedProcess(args=['python3', '/home/repl/workspace/test/file_1.py'], returncode=0, stdout=b'2021-07-16 10:14:38.510565\n')


Great work writing Python that writes Python. Think about that for a second! You used the pathlib module to do much of the heavy lifting to create Python scripts and then you used subprocess to verify them all.

import datetime;print(datetime.datetime.now())
