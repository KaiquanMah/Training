As a mad scientists working on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) in your underground bunker in Siberia, you have come up with a program that appears to show signs of human level intelligence. Your program was trained to write poems and initially showed signs of true brilliance. You read one of the poems and it seemed a bit creepy and repetitive. You need to write a script that inspects some of the output of the computer generated poems it is writing. The Unix command head will read the first few lines. The Unix command wc -w will count the total number of words. The name of the poem is called poem.txt.
Use subprocess.Popen to run each of these shell commands print the results. You must pass stdout=subprocess.PIPE into Popen to capture the output of wc.


Print the first few lines of /home/repl/workspace/poem.txt using head.
Count the total words in /home/repl/workspace/poem.txt using wc -w and print out the total.
Safely execute these commands by passing them in as items in a list.

You were able to safely run two Unix commands in subprocess.Popen and potentially prevent AI from taking over the world. The head command was used to print the first use lines. The wc -w command was used to count words.
