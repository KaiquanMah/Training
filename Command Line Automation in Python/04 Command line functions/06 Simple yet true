You need to convince your company to both use the click command-line tool and to open their new headquarters in an affordable city. Use this opportunity to create a random city selector and then print the results to stdout using click.

Use random.choice to select from cities in the values list.
Print the result to stdout using click's echo function.


script.py
import click
import random
random.seed(42)

# Create random values to choose from
values = ["Nashville", "Austin", "Denver", "Cleveland"]

# Select a random choice
result = random.choice(values)

# Print the random choice using click echo
click.echo(f"My choice is: {result}")



shell
repl:~/workspace$ python3 script.py
My choice is: Nashville

Great work, you were able to use click.echo to print to stdout. You may want to consider enhancing your script by using color formatting as well.
