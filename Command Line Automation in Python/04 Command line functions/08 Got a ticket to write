You have been reading through the click documentation while you are working on an data science project around housing prices in the United states. One thing you discover is that it incredibly easy to write to files from click. Take a few random words that come to mind and write them out via click. The click module has been imported for you.

Use click.open_file() to open a file for writing.
Use a loop to iterate over words.
Write the content in the words variable out to this file.
Read it back in to verify it was successful.




script.py
import click

# Setup
words = ["Asset", "Bubble", "10", "Year"]
filename = "words.txt"

# Write with click.open()
with click.open_file(filename, 'w') as f:

# Loop over words with a for loop
    for word in words:
        f.write(f'{word}\n')

# Read it back
with open(filename) as output_file:
    print(output_file.read())



shell
repl:~/workspace$ python3 script.py
Asset
Bubble
10
Year


#Great work using click.open_file() to write content out to a file. You have discovered how powerful click is as a centralized automation framework.
