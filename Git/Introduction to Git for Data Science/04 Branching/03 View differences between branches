How can I view the differences between branches?
Branches and revisions are closely connected, and commands that work on the latter usually work on the former. 
For example, just as git diff revision-1..revision-2 shows the difference between two versions of a repository, 
git diff branch-1..branch-2 shows the difference between two branches.

You are in the dental repository. How many files in the summary-statistics branch are different from their equivalents in the master branch?
