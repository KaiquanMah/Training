What are conflicts?

Sometimes the changes in two branches will conflict with each other: for example, bug fixes might touch the same lines of code, or analyses in two different branches may both append new (and different) records to a summary data file. In this case, Git relies on you to reconcile the conflicting changes.



The file todo.txt initially contains these two lines:

A) Write report.
B) Submit report.



You create a branch called update and modify the file to be:

A) Write report.
B) Submit final version.
C) Submit expenses.


You then switch back to the master branch and delete the first line, so that the file contains:

B) Submit report.


When you try to merge update and master, what conflicts does Git report? You can use git diff master..update to view the difference between the two branches.


$ git branch
  alter-report-title
* master
  summary-statistics
  update
$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results  todo.txt




$ git merge update master
Auto-merging todo.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in todo.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.


$ git diff master..update

#Just line B, since it is the only one to change in both branches.
#Correct: Git can merge the deletion of line A and the addition of line C automatically.
