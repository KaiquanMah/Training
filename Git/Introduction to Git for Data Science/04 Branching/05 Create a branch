How can I create a branch?
You might expect that you would use git branch to create a branch, and indeed this is possible. However, the most common thing you want to do is to create a branch then switch to that branch.

In the previous exercise, you used git checkout branch-name to switch to a branch. To create a branch then switch to it in one step, you add a -b flag, calling git checkout -b branch-name,

The contents of the new branch are initially identical to the contents of the original. Once you start making changes, they only affect the new branch.





1. You are in the master branch of the dental repository. Create a new branch called deleting-report.
$ cd dental$ git branch
  alter-report-title* master
  summary-statistics
  
  
$ git checkout -b deleting-report
Switched to a new branch 'deleting-report'
$ git branch
  alter-report-title
* deleting-report
  master
  summary-statistics




2. Use git rm report.txt to delete the report.
$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results
$ git rm report.txt
rm 'report.txt'
$ ls
bin  data  results

3. Commit your changes with a log message.
$ git commit -m "message"
[deleting-report 8e54bac] message
 1 file changed, 7 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 report.txt






4. Use git diff with appropriate arguments to compare the master branch with the new state of the deleting-report branch.
$ git diff master..deleting-report
diff --git a/report.txt b/report.txt
deleted file mode 100644
index 4c0742a..0000000
