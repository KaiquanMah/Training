How can I see what branches my repository has?
By default, every Git repository has a branch called master (which is why you have been seeing that word in Git's output in previous lessons). 
To list all of the branches in a repository, you can run the command "git branch". 
The branch you are currently in will be shown with a * beside its name.

You are in the dental repository. How many branches are in this repository (including master)?
#3 branches



$ cd dental
$ git branch
  alter-report-title
  * master
  summary-statistics
