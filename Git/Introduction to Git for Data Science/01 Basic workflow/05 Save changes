What's the first step in saving changes?
You commit changes to a Git repository in two steps:
1. Add one or more files to the staging area.
2. Commit everything in the staging area.

To add a file to the staging area, use git add filename.


You have been put in the dental repository. Use git add to add the file report.txt to the staging area.
$ cd dental
$ git add report.txt


Use another Git command to check the repository's status.

$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   report.txt
