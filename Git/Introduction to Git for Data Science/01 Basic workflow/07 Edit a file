Interlude: how can I edit a file?

Unix has a bewildering variety of text editors. In this course, we will sometimes use a very simple one called Nano. 
If you type nano filename, it will 
- open filename for editing 
- (or create it if it doesn't already exist). 

You can then move around with the arrow keys, 
delete characters with the backspace key, and so on. 

You can also do a few other operations with control-key combinations:
Ctrl-K: delete a line.
Ctrl-U: un-delete a line.
Ctrl-O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output').
Ctrl-X: exit the editor.




Run nano names.txt to edit a new file in your home directory and enter the following four lines:

Lovelace
Hopper
Johnson
Wilson

To save what you have written, type Ctrl-O to write the file out, 
then Enter to confirm the filename, 
then Ctrl-X and Enter to exit the editor.
