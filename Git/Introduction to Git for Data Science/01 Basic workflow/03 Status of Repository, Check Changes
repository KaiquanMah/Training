How can I check the state of a repository?
When you are using Git, you will frequently want to check the status of your repository. To do this, run the command "git status", which displays a list of the files that have been modified since the last time changes were saved.

You have been put in the dental repository. Use git status to discover which file(s) have been changed since the last save. Which file(s) are listed?

$ cd dental$ git status
On branch masterChanges not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   report.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$


report.txt













How can I tell what I have changed?
Git has a staging area in which it stores files with changes you want to save that haven't been saved yet. Putting files in the staging area is like putting things in a box, while committing those changes is like putting that box in the mail: you can add more things to the box or take things out as often as you want, but once you put it in the mail, you can't make further changes.

Working Directory             Staging Area                      .git Directory
report.md   -----to multiple ->  staged files   -----to----->    committed file

"git status"
shows you which files are in this staging area, and which files have changes that haven't yet been put there. 
In order to compare the file as it currently is to what you last saved, you can use "git diff filename". 
"git diff" without any filenames will show you all the changes in your repository, 
while "git diff directory" will show you the changes to the files in some directory.

You have been put in the dental repository. Use "git diff" to see what changes have been made to the files.
