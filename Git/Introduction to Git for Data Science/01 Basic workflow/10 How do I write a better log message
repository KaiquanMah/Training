How do I write a better log message
Writing a one-line log message with git commit -m "message"is good enough for very small changes, but your collaborators (including your future self) will appreciate more information. If you run git commit without -m "message", Git launches a text editor with a template like this:

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   skynet.R
#


The lines starting with # are comments, and won't be saved. (They are there to remind you what you are supposed to do and what files you have changed.) Your message should go at the top, and may be as long and as detailed as you want.
