How can I remove unwanted files?
Git can help you clean up files that you have told it you don't want. 
The command git clean -n 
will show you a list of files that are in the repository, but whose history Git is not currently tracking. 
A similar command git clean -f will then delete those files.

Use this command carefully: git clean only works on untracked files, so by definition, their history has not been saved. If you delete them with git clean -f, they're gone for good.



You are in the dental repository. Use git status to see the status of your repo.
backup.log appears to be an untracked file and it's one we don't need. Let's get rid of it. Use git clean with the appropriate flag to remove unwanted files.
Use ls to list the files in your current working directory. backup.log should no longer be there!




$ cd dental
$ git status
On branch masterUntracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        backup.log

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add"to track)

$ git clean -n
Would remove backup.log
$ git clean -f
Removing backup.log

$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results
