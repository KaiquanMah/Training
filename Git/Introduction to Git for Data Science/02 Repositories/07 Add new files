How do I add new files?
Git does not track files by default. Instead, it waits until you have used git add at least once before it starts paying attention to a file.

In the diagram you saw at the start of the chapter, the untracked files won't have a blob, and won't be listed in a tree.

The untracked files won't benefit from version control, so to make sure you don't miss anything, 
git status will always tell you about files that are in your repository but aren't (yet) being tracked.




You are in the dental repository. Use git status to find the files that aren't yet being tracked.
Use git add to add the new file to the staging area.
Use git commit to save the staged files with the message "Starting to track data sources."





$ cd dental
$ git status
On branch masterUntracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        sources.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add"to track)


$ git add sources.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   sources.txt


$ git commit -m "Starting to track data sources"
