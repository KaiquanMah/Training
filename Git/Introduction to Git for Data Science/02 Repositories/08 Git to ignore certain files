How do I tell Git to ignore certain files?
Data analysis often produces temporary or intermediate files that you don't want to save. 
You can tell it to stop paying attention to files you don't care about by creating a file in the root directory of your repository called 
.gitignore and storing a list of wildcard patterns that specify the files you don't want Git to pay attention to. 

For example, if .gitignore contains:
build
*.mpl

then Git will ignore any file or directory called build 
(and, if it's a directory, anything in it), 
as well as any file whose name ends in .mpl.



Which of the following files would not be ignored by a .gitignore that contained the lines:
pdf
*.pyc
backup




#YES report.pdf
#Correct: pdf does not contain any wildcards, so it only matches files called pdf.

#NOT bin/analyze.pyc
#NOT backup/northern.csv
