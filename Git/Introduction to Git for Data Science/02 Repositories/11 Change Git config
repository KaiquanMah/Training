How can I change my Git configuration?
Most of Git's settings should be left as they are. However, there are two you should set on every computer you use: your name and your email address. These are recorded in the log every time you commit a change, and are often used to identify the authors of a project's content in order to give credit (or assign blame, depending on the circumstances).

To change a configuration value for all of your projects on a particular computer, run the command:
git config --global setting value

Using this command, you specify the setting you want to change and the value you want to set. The settings that identify your name and email address are user.name and user.email, respectively.


Change the email address (user.email) configured for the current user for all projects to rep.loop@dc.com.



$ git config --list
user.email=repl@dc.com
user.name=Rep Loop
core.editor=nano

$ git config --global user.email rep.loop@dc.com

$ git config --list
user.email=rep.loop@dc.com
user.name=Rep Loop
core.editor=nano
