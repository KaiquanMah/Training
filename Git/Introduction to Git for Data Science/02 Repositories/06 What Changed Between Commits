How can I see what changed between two commits?
git show with a commit ID shows the changes made in a particular commit. 
To see the changes between two commits, you can use git diff ID1..ID2, where ID1 and ID2 identify the two commits you're interested in, 
and the connector .. is a pair of dots. 
For example, git diff abc123..def456 shows the differences between the commits abc123 and def456, 
while git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~3 shows the differences between the state of the repository one commit in the past and its state three commits in the past.

You are in the dental repository. Use git diff to view the differences between its current state and its state two commits previously. Which of the following files have changed?


$ cd dental
$ git diff HEAD..HEAD~2
diff --git a/data/western.csv b/data/western.csvindex f7c4509..f6d6374 100644
