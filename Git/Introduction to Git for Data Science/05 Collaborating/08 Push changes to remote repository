How can I push my changes to a remote repository?
The complement of git pull is git push, which pushes the changes you have made locally into a remote repository. The most common way to use it is:

git push remote-name branch-name
which pushes the contents of your branch branch-name into a branch with the same name in the remote repository associated with remote-name. It's possible to use different branch names at your end and the remote's end, but doing this quickly becomes confusing: it's almost always better to use the same names for branches across repositories.



1. You are in the master branch of the dental repository, which has a remote called origin. You have changed data/northern.csv; add it to the staging area.
$ cd dental
$ git remote -v
origin  /home/thunk/repo (fetch)origin  /home/thunk/repo (push)
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   data/northern.csv

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")





$ git add data/northern.csv
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   data/northern.csv
        
        
        
        
        

2. Commit your changes with the message "Added more northern data."
$ git commit -m "Added more northern data"
[master 7f2ab03] Added more northern data
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean





3. Push your changes to the remote repository origin, specifying the master branch.
$ git push origin master
