What happens if I try to pull when I have unsaved changes?
Just as Git stops you from switching branches when you have unsaved work, 
it also stops you from pulling in changes from a remote repository when doing so might overwrite things you have done locally. 

The fix is simple: 
either commit your local changes or 
revert them, and then try to pull again.

1. You are in the dental repository, which was cloned from a remote called origin. Use git pull to bring in changes from that repository.
$ cd dental
$ git remote -v
origin  /home/thunk/repo (fetch)
origin  /home/thunk/repo (push)

$ git pull origin /home/thunk/repo
fatal: Invalid refspec '/home/thunk/repo'

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   report.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")





2. Discard the changes in your repository.
$ git checkout -- .
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
nothing to commit, working directory clean




3. Re-try the git pull.
$ git pull origin /home/thunk/repo
