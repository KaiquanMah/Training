How can I find out where a cloned repository originated?
When you a clone a repository, Git remembers where the original repository was. It does this by storing a remote in the new repository's configuration. A remote is like a browser bookmark with a name and a URL.

If you use an online git repository hosting service like GitHub or Bitbucket, a common task would be that you clone a repository from that site to work locally on your computer. Then the copy on the website is the remote.

If you are in a repository, you can list the names of its remotes using git remote.

If you want more information, you can use git remote -v (for "verbose"), which shows the remote's URLs. Note that "URLs" is plural: it's possible for a remote to have several URLs associated with it for different purposes, though in practice each remote is almost always paired with just one URL.


You are in the dental repository. How many remotes does it have?



$ cd dental
$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results

$ git remote
origin
$ git remote -v
origin  /home/thunk/repo (fetch)
origin  /home/thunk/repo (push)

#1 remote; several URLs
