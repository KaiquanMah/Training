How can I create a brand new repository?
So far, you have been working with pre-existing repositories. 
If you want to create a repository for a new project in the current working directory, you can simply say git init project-name, 
where "project-name" is the name you want the new repository's root directory to have.

One thing you should not do is create one Git repository inside another. While Git does allow this, updating nested repositories becomes very complicated very quickly, since you need to tell Git which of the two .git directories the update is to be stored in. Very large projects occasionally need to do this, but most programmers and data analysts try to avoid getting into this situation.



Use a single command to create a new Git repository called optical in your current directory.

$ git init optical
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/repl/optical/.git/

#This was starting from scratch, but you'll often want to turn an existing folder into a Git repo as well. Find out how in the next exercise.
