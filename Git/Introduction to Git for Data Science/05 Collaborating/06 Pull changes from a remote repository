How can I pull in changes from a remote repository?
Git keeps track of remote repositories so that you can pull changes from those repositories and push changes to them.

Recall that the remote repository is often a repository in an online hosting service like GitHub. 
A typical workflow is that you pull in your collaborators' work from the remote repository so you have the latest version of everything, 
do some work yourself, 
then push your work back to the remote so that your collaborators have access to it.

Pulling changes is straightforward: the command git pull remote branch gets everything in branch in the remote repository identified by remote and 
merges it into the current branch of your local repository. 
For example, if you are in the quarterly-report branch of your local repository, the command:
git pull thunk latest-analysis
would get changes from latest-analysis branch in the repository associated with the remote called thunk and merge them into your quarterly-report branch.




You are in the master branch of the repository dental. Pull the changes from the master branch of the remote repository called origin.

$ cd dental
$ git branch
* master
$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results



$ git pull origin master
From /home/thunk/repo
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

#This git pull went smoothly, but unfortunately that's not always the case. Let's see what can happen if you have unsaved changes when trying to pull in changes.
