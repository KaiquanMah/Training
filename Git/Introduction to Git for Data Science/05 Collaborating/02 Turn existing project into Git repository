How can I turn an existing project into a Git repository?
Experienced Git users instinctively start new projects by creating repositories. 
If you are new to Git, though, or working with people who are, you will often want to convert existing projects into repositories. 

Doing so is simple, just run:
git init

in the project's root directory, or:
git init /path/to/project
from anywhere else on your computer.


1. You are in the directory dental, which is not yet a Git repository. Use a single command to convert it to a Git repository.
2. Check the status of your new repository.


$ pwd/home/repl/dental
$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results

$ git init /home/repl/dental
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/repl/dental/.git/

$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        bin/
        data/
        report.txt
        results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add"to track)



#After initializing the folder into a repository, Git immediately notices that there are a bunch of changes that can be staged (and afterwards, committed).
