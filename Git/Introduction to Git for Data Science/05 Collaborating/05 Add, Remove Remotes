How can I define remotes?
When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote called origin that points to the original repository. You can add more remotes using:
git remote add remote-name URL

and remove existing ones using:
git remote rm remote-name
You can connect any two Git repositories this way, but in practice, you will almost always connect repositories that share some common ancestry.


$ cd dental
$ git remote -v
$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results

$ git remote add thunk /home/thunk/repo
$ ls
bin  data  report.txt  results
$ git remote -v
thunk   /home/thunk/repo (fetch)
thunk   /home/thunk/repo (push)

#Now you added a remote to your local git repository.
