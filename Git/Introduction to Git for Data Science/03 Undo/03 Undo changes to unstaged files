How can I undo changes to unstaged files?
Suppose you have made changes to a file, then decide you want to undo them. Your text editor may be able to do this, but a more reliable way is to let Git do the work. The command:
git checkout -- filename
will discard the changes that have not yet been staged. (The double dash -- must be there to separate the git checkout command from the names of the file or files you want to recover.)

Use this command carefully: once you discard changes in this way, they are gone forever.




You are in the dental repository, where all changes to .csv files in data were staged. git status shows that data/northern.csv was changed again after it was staged. Use a Git command to undo the changes to the file data/northern.csv.



$ cd dental
$ git add data/*.csv
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   data/eastern.csv
        modified:   data/northern.csv

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   data/northern.csv



$ git checkout -- data/northern.csv
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   data/eastern.csv
        modified:   data/northern.csv
