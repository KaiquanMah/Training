How can I commit changes selectively?
You don't have to put all of the changes you have made recently into the staging area at once. For example, suppose you are adding a feature to analysis.R and spot a bug in cleanup.R. After you have fixed it, you want to save your work. Since the changes to cleanup.R aren't directly related to the work you're doing in analysis.R, you should save your work in two separate commits.

The syntax for staging a single file is git add path/to/file.

If you make a mistake and accidentally stage a file you shouldn't have, you can unstage the additions with git reset HEAD and try again.





From the output of git status on the right, you'll see that two files were changed; data/northern.csv and data/eastern.csv. Stage only the changes made to data/northern.csv.
Commit those changes with the message "Adding data from northern region."
