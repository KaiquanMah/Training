How do I re-stage files?
People often save their work every few minutes when they're using a desktop text editor. Similarly, it's common to use git add periodically to save the most recent changes to a file to the staging area. This is particularly useful when the changes are experimental and you might want to undo them without cluttering up the repository's history.



You are in the dental repository. Use git status to check the status of the repository.
It appears that some changes to data/northern.csv have already been staged, but there are new changes that haven't been staged yet. Use git add to stage these latest changes to data/northern.csv again.



$ cd dental
$ git add data/northern.csv
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   data/northern.csv

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   data/northern.csv



$ git add data/northern.csv
$ git status
