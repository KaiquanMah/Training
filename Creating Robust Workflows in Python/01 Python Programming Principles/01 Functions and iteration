Functions and iteration
In this exercise, we'll define two functions, print_files() and list_files(), that will each use read_text().
The print_files() function will use a for loop to print file contents and not return anything.
The list_files() function will use a list comprehension to return a list of file contents.
In the video, we used the Path class's read_text() method to read in text files.
If you don't remember how this worked, you can take a look at the slides.
Path has already been imported from the pathlib module.
We will also use the pprint() function (short for pretty print) from the standard library pprint module to make the list output a little more readable.



In the print_files() function definition, set up the iteration instructions for the for loop.
Use the for loop to pass each the contents of each file to print().
In the list_files() function definition, use the read_text() method to read file contents.
Set up the list comprehension to pass each filename to Path.


def print_files(filenames):
    # Set up the loop iteration instructions
    for name in filenames:
        # Use pathlib.Path to print out each file
        print(Path(name).read_text())
      
        
def list_files(filenames):
    # Use pathlib.Path to read the contents of each file
    return [Path(name).read_text()
            # Obtain each name from the list of filenames
            for name in filenames]


filenames = "diabetes.txt", "boston.txt", "digits.txt", "iris.txt", "wine.txt"
print_files(filenames)
pprint(list_files(filenames))

Diabetes dataset
----------------

Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood
pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n =
442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a
quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

  :Number of Instances: 442

  :Number of Attributes: First 10 columns are numeric predictive values

  :Target: Column 11 is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline

  :Attribute Information:
      - Age
      - Sex
      - Body mass index
      - Average blood pressure
      - S1
      - S2
      - S3
      - S4
      - S5
      - S6

Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times `n_samples` (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).

This is a copy of the test set of the UCI ML hand-written digits datasets
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits

The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where
each class refers to a digit.

Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract
normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a
total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13
to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of
4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates
an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range
0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small
distortions.

The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken
from Fisher's paper. Note that it's the same as in R, but not as in the UCI
Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
