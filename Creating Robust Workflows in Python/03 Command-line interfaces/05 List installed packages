List installed packages
In this exercise, we will create a venv virtual environment and then make sure we are using a relatively recent of version pandas.
We will use the pip list command to pick out pandas from a list of all the packages available in our virtual environment.


Create a virtual environment.
Run pip list and assign the resulting CompletedProcess instance to a variable called cp.

# Create an virtual environment
venv.create(".venv")

# Run pip list and obtain a CompletedProcess instance
cp = subprocess.run([".venv/bin/python", "-m", "pip", "list"], stdout=-1)

for line in cp.stdout.decode().split("\n"):
    if "pandas" in line:
        print(line)

<script.py> output:
    pandas             0.24.2
    
Unrivaled updating! Helping users set up a virtual environment in which to run your code demonstrates conscientiousness and empathy. Next, we will look at how we can use venv and pip to install project dependencies inside of a virtual environment.
