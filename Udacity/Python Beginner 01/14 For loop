#1st iteration outer starts at 2; inner starts at 2, up to 2, i.e. up to 1, so inner loop never executes; so go to the else clause and print that the number is a prime
#2nd iteration outer is 3; inner is 2, up to 3, so 3%2=1; there is remainder, ie TRUE; NOT TRUE = FALSE; dont execute the print code; move back to the inner for loop
#3rd iteration outer remains at 3; inner is up to but not including 3; so move on to the else clause and print that the number is a prime

#outer=4; inner=2 to 4; start with inner 2; 4%2=0, no remainder; NOT 0 = TRUE, so execute print statement and break to go up to the inner for loop again
#outer=4; inner now 3; 4%3=1, there is remainder/TRUE; NOT TRUE = FALSE; skip print statement
