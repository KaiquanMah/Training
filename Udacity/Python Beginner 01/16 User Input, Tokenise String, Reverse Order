#Tutorial - Get name, then show first and last name at their original positions but characters are in reverse order

#method 1
name = input ('First and last name to reverse -> ')
words = name.split("")			#words = ['firstname','lastname']


for word in words:				#for each element in the list
	lastindex = len(word) -1	#calculate position of last character
  
  for index in range(lastindex, -1, -1):	#start from last position, up to and including first position, in reverse order
		  print(word[index], end="")			#print the character at a particular position of the word; "" = do not leave a space between characters
      
	print(end=' ')				#once the word has been printed, print a space between each word
  print(end='\n')					#'\n' = move on to the next line



#method 2

name = input ('First and last name to reverse -> ')
first, last  = name.split()		#first = firstname, last = lastname
print(first[::-1], last[::-1])	#print each string; all characters in reverse order
