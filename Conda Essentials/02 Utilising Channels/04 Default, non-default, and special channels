Default, non-default, and special channels
The default channel on Anaconda Cloud is curated by Anaconda Inc., but another channel called conda-forge also has a special status. This channel does not operate any differently than other channels, whether those others are associated with an individual or organization, but it acts as a kind of "community curation" of relatively well-vetted packages. The GitHub page for the conda-forge project at https://github.com/conda-forge describes it as: "A community led collection of recipes, build infrastructure and distributions for the conda package manager."
Apart from the somewhat more organized conda-forge channel/project, Anaconda Cloud channels are relatively anarchic. Much like GitHub repos or packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI), anyone is free to upload whatever projects they like to conda-forge (as long as they are assembled as Conda packages, that is, but this is a minor restriction).
You should generally trust or rely only on packages sourced from reputable channels. There is no inherent rating system for channels or their packages. However, you are likely to trust your colleagues, your organization, well-known people in your software or data science communities, and so on.
conda-forge is almost certainly the most widely used channel on Anaconda Cloud. In fact, it has very many more packages than the main channel itself. Use the tools from this course to make a rough estimate of the number of packages available on the conda-forge channel for the linux-64 platform (i.e., the platform used for this session).
