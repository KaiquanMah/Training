Searching across channels
Although the conda command and its subcommands are used for nearly everything in this course, the package anaconda-client provides the command anaconda that searches in a different manner that is often more useful. For instance, you may know the name of the textadapter package, but you may not know in which channel (or channels) it may be published (or by which users). You can search across all channels and all platforms using:

$ anaconda search textadapter
