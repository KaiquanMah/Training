Remove an environment
From time to time, it is worth cleaning up the environments you have accumulated just to make management easier. Doing so is not pressing; as they use little space or resources. But it's definitely useful to be able to see a list of only as many environments as are actually useful for you.

The command to remove an environment is:
conda env remove --name ENVNAME


You may also use the shorter -n switch instead.


(base) $ conda env list
# conda environments:
#
_tmp                     /.conda/envs/_tmp
course-env               /.conda/envs/course-env
course-project           /.conda/envs/course-project
deprecated               /.conda/envs/deprecated
pd-2015                  /.conda/envs/pd-2015
py1.0                    /.conda/envs/py1.0
test-env                 /.conda/envs/test-env
base                  *  /home/repl/miniconda




The current session has an environment named deprecated. Remove it from the session.
(base) $ conda env remove --name deprecated
Remove all packages in environment /.conda/envs/deprecated:

(base) $ conda env list
# conda environments:
#
_tmp                     /.conda/envs/_tmp
course-env               /.conda/envs/course-env
course-project           /.conda/envs/course-project
pd-2015                  /.conda/envs/pd-2015
py1.0                    /.conda/envs/py1.0
test-env                 /.conda/envs/test-env
base                  *  /home/repl/miniconda
