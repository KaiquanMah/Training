# loc and iloc can perform data selection operations on DataFrames
# loc is label-based, so specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels
# iloc is integer index based, so specify rows and columns by their integer index

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out observation for Japan as a Series
# Series uses single square brackets
print(cars.loc['JAP'])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt as a DataFrame
# DataFrame uses double square brackets
print(cars.loc[['AUS','EG']])
