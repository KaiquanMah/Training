#The process
In a bar you strike up a conversation with someone who turns out to be a data scientist at the self-driving car department of Tesla.
They start talking about one of the deep learning models they built a while ago. It was able to classify images of vehicles as cars or trucks. You discuss the process and at the end of the conversation you have a pretty good idea of what happened.


Place the steps that happen inside a neural network in the right order.

Transform car images into numbers
Feed pixel intensities into a neural network
Neurons learn to detect edges
Neurons learn to decipher complex images e.g. wheels, doors, windows
Neurons learn to detect shapes of vehicles
Classify image as a CAR OR TRUCK


#Remember that the great thing about this algorithm is that the neurons in the middle figure out the features by themselves.
