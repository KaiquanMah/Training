Business case using lift curve
In the video you learned to implement a method that calculates the profit of a campaign:
profit = profit(perc_targets, perc_selected, population_size, campaign_cost, campaign_reward)

In this method, perc_targets is the percentage of targets in the group that you select for your campaign, perc_selected the percentage of people that is selected for the campaign, population_size the total population size, campaign_cost the cost of addressing a single person for the campaign, and campaign_reward the reward of addressing a target.
In this exercise you will learn for a specific case whether it is useful to use a model, by comparing the profit that is made when addressing all donors versus the top 40% of the donors.




# Plot the lift graph
skplt.metrics.plot_lift_curve(targets_test,predictions_test)
plt.show()

# Read the lift at 40% (round it up to the upper tenth)
perc_selected = 0.4
lift = 1.5
#read from the chart


# Information about the campaign
population_size, target_incidence, campaign_cost, campaign_reward = 100000, 0.01, 1, 100
    
# Profit if all donors are targeted
profit_all = profit(target_incidence, .4, population_size, campaign_cost, campaign_reward)
print(profit_all)
    0.0


# Profit if top 40% of donors are targeted
profit_40 = profit(lift * target_incidence, 0.4, population_size, campaign_cost, campaign_reward)
print(profit_40)
    20000.0
When addressing the entire donor base, you do not make any profit at all. When using the predictive model, you can make 20,000 Euro profit!






Business case using cumulative gains curve
The cumulative gains graph can be used to estimate how many donors one should address to make a certain profit. Indeed, the cumulative gains graph shows which percentage of all targets is reached when addressing a certain percentage of the population. If one knows the reward of a campaign, it follows easily how many donors should be targeted to reach a certain profit.
In this exercise, you will calculate how many donors you should address to obtain a 30 000 Euro profit.


# Plot the cumulative gains
skplt.metrics.plot_cumulative_gain(targets_test, predictions_test)
plt.show()

# Number of targets you want to reach
number_targets_toreach = 30000 / 50
600.0
#30k profit
#50 profit per target

perc_targets_toreach = number_targets_toreach / 1000
0.6
1000 total # targets

perc_donors = .4
number_donors_toreach = perc_donors * 10000
#population size=10000

It looks like you need to address 4,000 donors!
