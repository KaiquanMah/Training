Constructing the lift curve
The lift curve is an evaluation curve that assesses the performance of your model. It shows how many times more than average the model reaches targets.
To construct this curve, you can use the plot_lift_curve method in the scikitplot module and the matplotlib.pyplot module. As for each model evaluation metric or curve, you need the true target values on the one hand and the predictions on the other hand to construct the cumulative gains curve.



# Import the matplotlib.pyplot module 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import the scikitplot module
import scikitplot as skplt

# Plot the lift curve
skplt.metrics.plot_lift_curve(targets_test,predictions_test)
plt.show()





A perfect model
In this exercise you will reconstruct the lift curve of a perfect model. To do so, you need to construct perfect predictions.
Recall that the plot_lift_curve method requires two values for the predictions argument: the first argument for the target to be 0 and the second one for the target to be 1.

# Generate perfect predictions
perfect_predictions = [(1-target , target) for target in targets_test["target"]]

# Plot the lift curve
skplt.metrics.plot_lift_curve(targets_test, perfect_predictions)
plt.show()
You can observe that the lift is first 20, which is normal as there are 5% targets: you can only have 20 times more than average targets. After that the lift gradually decreases because there are no targets to add anymore.
