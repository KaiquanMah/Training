The first 10 variables that are added to the model are the following:
['max_gift', 'number_gift', 'time_since_last_gift', 'mean_gift', 'income_high', 'age', 'country_USA', 'gender_F', 'income_low', 'country_UK']

As you can see, min_gift is not added. Does this mean that it is a bad variable? You can test the performance of the variable by using it in a model as a single variable and calculating the AUC. How does the AUC of min_gift compare to the AUC of income_high? To this end, you can use the function auc():
auc(variables, target, basetable)

It can happen that a good variable is not added because it is highly correlated with a variable that is already in the model. You can test this calculating the correlation between these variables:
import numpy
numpy.corrcoef(basetable["variable_1"],basetable["variable_2"])[0,1]



import numpy as np

# Calculate the AUC of the model using min_gift only
auc_min_gift = auc(["min_gift"], ["target"], basetable)
print(round(auc_min_gift,2))
    0.57


# Calculate the AUC of the model using income_high only
auc_income_high = auc(["income_high"], ["target"], basetable)
print(round(auc_income_high,2))
    0.52
    
    
# Calculate the correlation between min_gift and mean_gift
correlation = np.corrcoef(basetable["min_gift"], basetable["mean_gift"])[0,1]
print(round(correlation,2))
    0.76
You can observe that min_gift has more predictive power than income_high, but that it is highly correlated with mean_gift and therefore not included in the selected variables.
