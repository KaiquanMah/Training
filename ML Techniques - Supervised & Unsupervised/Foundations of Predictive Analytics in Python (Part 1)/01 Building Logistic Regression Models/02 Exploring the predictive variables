It is always useful to get a better understanding of the population. Therefore, one can have a closer look at the predictive variables. Recall that you can select a column in a pandas dataframe by indexing as follows:
basetable["variable"]

To count the number of occurrences of a certain value in a column, you can use the sum method:
sum(basetable["variable"]==value)

In this exercise you will find out whether there are more males than females in the population.




   id  target gender  age
0   1       1      F   55
1   2       1      M   71
2   3       1      M   28
3   4       1      F   77
4   5       1      F   79



# Count and print the number of females.
print(sum(basetable["gender"] == 'F'))
50624


# Count and print the number of males.
print(sum(basetable["gender"] == 'M'))
49376
