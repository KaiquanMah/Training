Once your model is ready, you can use it to make predictions for a campaign. It is important to always use the latest information to make predictions.

In this exercise you will, given a fitted logistic regression model, learn how to make predictions for a new, updated basetable.

The logistic regression model that you built in the previous exercises has been added and fitted for you in logreg.





# Fit a logistic regression model
from sklearn import linear_model
X = basetable[["age","gender_F","time_since_last_gift"]]
y = basetable[["target"]]
logreg = linear_model.LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X, y)

# Create a dataframe new_data from current_data that has only the relevant predictors 
new_data = current_data[["age","gender_F","time_since_last_gift"]]
#alternative method
#current_data.columns
#cols=current_data.columns
#newdf=current_data[cols]

# Make a prediction for each observation in new_data and assign it to predictions
predictions = logreg.predict_proba(new_data)
print(predictions[0:5])


The predictions consist of two values. The second value is the probability that the observation is a target.
    [[0.94254824 0.05745176]
     [0.97375722 0.02624278]
     [0.96793614 0.03206386]
     [0.90081414 0.09918586]
     [0.96936349 0.03063651]]
