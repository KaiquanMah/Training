Before diving into model building, it is important to understand the data you are working with. In this exercise, you will learn how to obtain the population size, number of targets and target incidence from a given basetable.




# Assign the number of rows in the basetable to the variable 'population_size'.
population_size  = len(basetable.index)
#basetable.count
#basetable.shape[0]

# Print the population size.
print(population_size)
    100000


# Assign the number of targets to the variable 'targets_count'.
targets_count = sum(basetable["target"]==1)

# Print the number of targets.
print(targets_count)
    4990


# Print the target incidence.
print(targets_count / population_size)
    0.0499
    
    
    

As in many real world predictive modeling cases, the incidence is rather low. This makes model building challenging!
