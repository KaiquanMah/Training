04 Prep Data For Predictor Insight Graph
Calculating average incidences
The most important column in the predictor insight graph table is the target incidence column. This column shows the average target value for each group.




# Select the income and target columns
basetable_income = basetable[["target","income"]]

# Group basetable_income by income
groups = basetable_income.groupby("income")

# Calculate the target incidence and print the result
incidence = groups["target"].agg({"Incidence" : np.mean}).reset_index()
print(incidence)
        income  Incidence
    0  average   0.049166
    1     high   0.061543
    2      low   0.043118
You can observe that the higher a donor's income, the more likely he is to donate for the campaign.









Constructing the predictor insight graph table
In the previous exercise you learned how to calculate the incidence column of the predictor insight graph table. In this exercise, you will also add the size of the groups, and wrap everything in a function that returns the predictor insight graph table for a given variable.


# Function that creates predictor insight graph table
def create_pig_table(basetable, target, variable):
  
    # Create groups for each variable
    groups = basetable[[target,variable]].groupby(variable)
    
    # Calculate size and target incidence for each group
    pig_table = groups[target].agg({'Incidence' : np.mean, 'Size' : np.size}).reset_index()
    
    # Return the predictor insight graph table
    return pig_table

# Calculate the predictor insight graph table for the variable gender
pig_table_gender = create_pig_table(basetable, "target", "gender")

# Print the result
print(pig_table_gender)

      gender   Size  Incidence
    0      F  50033   0.053844
    1      M  49967   0.045970
    
The predictor insight graph table shows that females are more likely to donate than males













Grouping all predictor insight graph tables
In the previous exercise, you constructed a function that calculates the predictor insight graph table for a given variable as follows:
pig_table = create_pig_table(basetable, "target","variable")

If you want to calculate the predictor insight graph table for many variables at once, it is a good idea to store them in a dictionary. You can create a new dictionary using dictionary = {}, add elements with a key using dictionary["key"] = value and retrieve elements using the key print(dictionary["key"]).

# Create the list of variables for our predictor insight graph tables
variables = ["income","gender","disc_mean_gift","disc_time_since_last_gift"]

# Create an empty dictionary
pig_tables = {}

# Loop through the variables
for variable in variables:
  
    # Create a predictor insight graph table
    pig_table = create_pig_table(basetable, "target", variable)
    
    # Add the table to the dictionary
    pig_tables[variable] = pig_table

# Print the predictor insight graph table of the variable "disc_time_since_last_gift"
print(pig_tables["disc_time_since_last_gift"])


      disc_time_since_last_gift   Size  Incidence
    0              (1050, 2518]  19953   0.023255
    1                (462, 657]  20069   0.061986
    2                (657, 833]  19996   0.050810
    3               (833, 1050]  19971   0.033799
    4                 [32, 462]  20011   0.079556
    
    
    
The predictor insight graph table shows that people who donated recently are more likely to donate again.
