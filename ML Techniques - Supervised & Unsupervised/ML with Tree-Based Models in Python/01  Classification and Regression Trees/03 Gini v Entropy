Using entropy as a criterion
In this exercise, you'll train a classification tree on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using entropy as an information criterion. You'll do so using all the 30 features in the dataset, which is split into 80% train and 20% test.

X_train as well as the array of labels y_train are available in your workspace.



# Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Instantiate dt_entropy, set 'entropy' as the information criterion
dt_entropy = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=8, criterion='entropy', random_state=1)

# Fit dt_entropy to the training set
dt_entropy.fit(X_train, y_train)

In the next exercise, you'll compare the accuracy of dt_entropy to the accuracy of a another tree trained using the gini-index as the information criterion.







Entropy vs Gini index
In this exercise you'll compare the test set accuracy of dt_entropy to the accuracy of another tree named dt_gini. The tree dt_gini was trained on the same dataset using the same parameters except for the information criterion which was set to the gini index using the keyword 'gini'.

X_test, y_test, dt_entropy, as well as accuracy_gini which corresponds to the test set accuracy achieved by dt_gini are available in your workspace.


# Import accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Use dt_entropy to predict test set labels
y_pred= dt_entropy.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy_entropy
accuracy_entropy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print accuracy_entropy
print('Accuracy achieved by using entropy: ', accuracy_entropy)

# Print accuracy_gini
print('Accuracy achieved by using the gini index: ', accuracy_gini)

    Accuracy achieved by using entropy:  0.929824561404
    Accuracy achieved by using the gini index:  0.929824561404




Notice how the two models achieve exactly the same accuracy. Most of the time, the gini index and entropy lead to the same results. The gini index is slightly faster to compute and is the default criterion used in the DecisionTreeClassifier model of scikit-learn.
