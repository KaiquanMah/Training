Prepare the ground
In the following exercises, you'll compare the OOB accuracy to the test set accuracy of a bagging classifier trained on the Indian Liver Patient dataset.

In sklearn, you can evaluate the OOB accuracy of an ensemble classifier by setting the parameter oob_score to True during instantiation. After training the classifier, the OOB accuracy can be obtained by accessing the .oob_score_ attribute from the corresponding instance.

In your environment, we have made available the class DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree.




# Import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=8, random_state=1)

# Instantiate bc
bc = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=dt, 
            n_estimators=50,
            oob_score=True,
            random_state=1)
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            


OOB Score vs Test Set Score
Now that you instantiated bc, you will fit it to the training set and evaluate its test set and OOB accuracies.

The dataset is processed for you and split into 80% train and 20% test. The feature matrices X_train and X_test, as well as the arrays of labels y_train and y_test are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded the classifier bc instantiated in the previous exercise and the function accuracy_score() from sklearn.metrics.

# Fit bc to the training set 
bc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = bc.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate test set accuracy
acc_test = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Evaluate OOB accuracy
acc_oob = bc.oob_score_

# Print acc_test and acc_oob
print('Test set accuracy: {:.3f}, OOB accuracy: {:.3f}'.format(acc_test, acc_oob))

Test set accuracy: 0.698, OOB accuracy: 0.704


The test set accuracy and the OOB accuracy of bc are both roughly equal to 70%!
