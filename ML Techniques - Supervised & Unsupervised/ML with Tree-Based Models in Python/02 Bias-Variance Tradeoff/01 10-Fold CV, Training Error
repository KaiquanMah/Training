Instantiate the model
In the following set of exercises, you'll diagnose the bias and variance problems of a regression tree. The regression tree you'll define in this exercise will be used to predict the mpg consumption of cars from the auto dataset using all available features.

We have already processed the data and loaded the features matrix X and the array y in your workspace. In addition, the DecisionTreeRegressor class was imported from sklearn.tree.



# Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Set SEED for reproducibility
SEED = 1

# Split the data into 70% train and 30% test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.3, random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate a DecisionTreeRegressor dt
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=4, min_samples_leaf=0.26, random_state=SEED)






Evaluate the 10-fold CV error
In this exercise, you'll evaluate the 10-fold CV Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) achieved by the regression tree dt that you instantiated in the previous exercise.

In addition to dt, the training data including X_train and y_train are available in your workspace. We also imported cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection.

Note that since cross_val_score has only the option of evaluating the negative MSEs, its output should be multiplied by negative one to obtain the MSEs.





# Compute the array containing the 10-folds CV MSEs
MSE_CV_scores = - cross_val_score(dt, X_train, y_train, cv=10, 
                       scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
                       n_jobs=-1)

# Compute the 10-folds CV RMSE
RMSE_CV = (MSE_CV_scores.mean())**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_CV
print('CV RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_CV))
    CV RMSE: 5.14
 A very good practice is to keep the test set untouched until you are confident about your model's performance. CV is a great technique to get an estimate of a model's performance without affecting the test set.








Evaluate the training error
You'll now evaluate the training set RMSE achieved by the regression tree dt that you instantiated in a previous exercise.

In addition to dt, X_train and y_train are available in your workspace.


# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict the labels of the training set
y_pred_train = dt.predict(X_train)

# Evaluate the training set RMSE of dt
RMSE_train = (mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred_train))**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_train
print('Train RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_train))
    Train RMSE: 5.15


Notice how the training error is roughly equal to the 10-folds CV error you obtained in the previous exercice.









High bias or high variance?
In this exercise you'll diagnose whether the regression tree dt you trained in the previous exercise suffers from a bias or a variance problem.

The training set RMSE (RMSE_train) and the CV RMSE (RMSE_CV) achieved by dt are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded a variable called baseline_RMSE which corresponds to the root mean-squared error achieved by the regression-tree trained with the disp feature only (it is the RMSE achieved by the regression tree trained in chapter 1, lesson 3). Here baseline_RMSE serves as the baseline RMSE above which a model is considered to be underfitting and below which the model is considered 'good enough'.

Does dt suffer from a high bias or a high variance problem?
dt suffers from high bias because RMSE_CV â‰ˆ RMSE_train and both scores are greater than baseline_RMSE.
dt is indeed underfitting the training set as the model is too constrained to capture the nonlinear dependencies between features and labels.
