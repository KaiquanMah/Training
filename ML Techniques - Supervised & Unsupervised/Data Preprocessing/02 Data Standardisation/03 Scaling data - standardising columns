Since we know that the Ash, Alcalinity of ash, and Magnesium columns in the wine dataset are all on different scales, let's standardize them in a way that allows for use in a linear model.

# Import StandardScaler from scikit-learn
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create the scaler
ss = StandardScaler()

# Take a subset of the DataFrame you want to scale 
wine_subset = wine[["Ash", "Alcalinity of ash", "Magnesium"]]

#Apply the ss.fit_transform method to the wine_subset DataFrame.
# Apply the scaler to the DataFrame subset
wine_subset_scaled = ss.fit_transform(wine_subset)

In scikit-learn, running fit_transform during preprocessing will both fit the method to the data as well as transform the data in a single step.
