Now that we know that the Proline column in our wine dataset has a large amount of variance, let's log normalize it.

Numpy has been imported as np in your workspace.




# Print out the variance of the Proline column
print(np.var(wine.Proline))

# Apply the log normalization function to the Proline column
Proline_log = np.log(wine["Proline"])

# Check the variance of the Proline column again
print(np.var(Proline_log))
