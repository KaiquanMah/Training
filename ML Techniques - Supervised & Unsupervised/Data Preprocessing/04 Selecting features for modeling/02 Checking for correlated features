Let's take a look at the wine dataset again, which is made up of continuous, numerical features. Run Pearson's correlation coefficient on the dataset to determine which columns are good candidates for eliminating. Then, remove those columns from the DataFrame.


# Print out the column correlations of the wine dataset
print(wine.corr())
                              Flavanoids    ...          Hue
Flavanoids                      1.000000    ...     0.543479
Total phenols                   0.864564    ...     0.433681
Malic acid                     -0.411007    ...    -0.561296
OD280/OD315 of diluted wines    0.787194    ...     0.565468
Hue                             0.543479    ...     1.000000

[5 rows x 5 columns]



# Take a minute to find the column where the correlation value is greater than 0.75 at least twice
to_drop = "Flavanoids"

# Drop that column from the DataFrame
wine = wine.drop(to_drop, axis=1)
