Take a look at the UFO dataset's column types using the dtypes attribute. Two columns jump out for transformation: the seconds column, which is a numeric column but is being read in as object, and the date column, which can be transformed into the datetime type. That will make our feature engineering efforts easier later on.

# Check the column types

# Change the type of seconds to float
ufo["seconds"] = ufo["seconds"].astype("float")

# Change the date column to type datetime
ufo["date"] = pd.to_datetime(ufo["date"])

# Check the column types
print(ufo[["date", "seconds"]].dtypes)

    date       datetime64[ns]
    seconds           float64
