Let's transform the desc column in the UFO dataset into tf/idf vectors, since there's likely something we can learn from this field.



# Take a look at the head of the desc field
print(ufo["desc"].head())

Name: desc, dtype: object




# Create the tfidf vectorizer object
vec = TfidfVectorizer()

# Use vec's fit_transform method on the desc field
desc_tfidf = vec.fit_transform(ufo["desc"])

# Look at the number of columns this creates
#The output is in the shape (rows, columns).
print(desc_tfidf.shape)
