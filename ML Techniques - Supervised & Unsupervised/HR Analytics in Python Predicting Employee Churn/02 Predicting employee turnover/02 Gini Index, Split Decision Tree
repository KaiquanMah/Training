Computing Gini index
The decision tree algorithm aims to achieve partitions in the terminal nodes that are as pure as possible. The Gini index is one of the methods used to achieve this. It is calculated based on the proportion of samples in each group.

Given the number of people who stayed and left respectively, calculate the Gini index for that node.




#number of people who stayed/left
stayed = 37
left = 1138

#sum of stayed and left
total = stayed + left

#gini index
gini = 2*(stayed/total)*(left/total)





Splitting the tree
Given the Gini index that would result from splitting by either variable A or B, respectively, decide by which variable the tree should split next.



# Gini index in case of splitting by variable A or B
gini_A = 0.65
gini_B = 0.15

# check which Gini is lower and use it for spliting
if gini_A < gini_B:
    print("split by A!")
else:
    print("split by B!")
