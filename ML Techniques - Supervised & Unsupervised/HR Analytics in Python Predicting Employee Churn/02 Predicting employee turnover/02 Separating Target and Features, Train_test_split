In order to make a prediction (in this case, whether an employee would leave or not), one needs to separate the dataset into two components:
the dependent variable or target which needs to be predicted
the independent variables or features that will be used to make a prediction

Your task is to separate the target and features. The target you have here is the employee churn, and features include everything else.

Reminder: the dataset has already been modified by encoding categorical variables and getting dummies.

pandas has been imported for you as pd.




# Set the target and features

# Choose the dependent variable column (churn) and set it as target
target = data.churn

# Drop column churn and set everything else as features
features = data.drop("churn",axis=1)

Spliting employee data
Overfitting the dataset is a common problem in analytics. This happens when a model is working well on the dataset it was developed upon, but fails to generalize outside of it.

A train/test split is implemented to ensure model generalization: you develop the model using the training sample and try it out on the test sample later on.

In this exercise, you will split both target and features into train and test sets with 75%/25% ratio, respectively.

# Import the function for splitting dataset into train and test
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Use that function to create the splits both for target and for features
# Set the test sample to be 25% of your observations
target_train, target_test, features_train, features_test = train_test_split(target,features,test_size=0.25,random_state=42)
