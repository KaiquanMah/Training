In Decision Tree classification tasks, overfitting is usually the result of deeply grown trees. As the comparison of accuracy scores on the train and test sets shows, you have overfitting in your results. This can also be learned from the tree visualization.

In this exercise, you will export the decision tree into a text document, which can then be used for visualization.





# Import the graphical visualization export function
from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz

# Apply Decision Tree model to fit Features to the Target
model.fit(features_train,target_train)

# Export the tree to a dot file
export_graphviz(model,"tree.dot")
Now you can copy the content of tree.dot file and preview it in webgraphviz.com!
