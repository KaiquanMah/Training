Calculating accuracy metrics: precision
The Precision score is an important metric used to measure the accuracy of a classification algorithm. It is calculated as the fraction of True Positives over the sum of True Positives and False Positives, or

# of True Positives/
(# of True Positives  + # of False Positives)

we define True Positives as the number of employees who actually left, and were classified correctly as leaving
we define False Positives as the number of employees who actually stayed, but were wrongly classified as leaving

If there are no False Positives, the precision score is equal to 1. If there are no True Positives, the recall score is equal to 0.
In this exercise, we will calculate the precision score (using the sklearn function precision_score) for our initial classification model.
The variables features_test and target_test are available in your workspace.




# Import the function to calculate precision score
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

# Predict whether employees will churn using the test set
prediction = model.predict(features_test)

# Calculate precision score by comparing target_test with the prediction
precision_score(target_test, prediction)
0.9356913183279743


model.predict_proba(features_test)
array([[1., 0.],
       [1., 0.],
       [1., 0.],
       ...,
       [1., 0.],
       [0., 1.],
       [1., 0.]])


model.predict(features_test)
array([0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0])













Calculating accuracy metrics: recall
The Recall score is another important metric used to measure the accuracy of a classification algorithm. It is calculated as the** fraction of True Positives over the sum of True Positives and False Negatives**, or

# of True Positives/
(# of True Positives  + # of False Negatives)

If there are no False Negatives, the recall score is equal to 1. If there are no True Positives, the recall score is equal to 0.
In this exercise, you will calculate the precision score (using the sklearn function recall_score) for your initial classification model.
The variables features_test and target_test are available in your workspace.




# Import the function to calculate recall score
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

# Use the initial model to predict churn
prediction = model.predict(features_test)

# Calculate recall score by comparing target_test with the prediction
recall_score(target_test, prediction)
