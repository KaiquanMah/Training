In this exercise, your task is to compare the balanced and imbalanced (default) models using the pruned tree (max_depth=7). The imbalanced model is already done using recall and ROC/AUC scores. Complete the same steps for the balanced model.

The variables features_train, target_train, features_test and target_test are already available in your workspace.
An imbalanced model has already been fit for you and, and its predictions saved as prediction.
The functions recall_score() and roc_auc_score() have been imported for you.



# Print the recall score
print(recall_score(target_test,prediction))
    0.9253897550111359

# Print the ROC/AUC score
print(roc_auc_score(target_test,prediction))
    0.9597145128491865



# Initialize the model
model_depth_7_b = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=7,class_weight="balanced",random_state=42)
# Fit it to the training component
model_depth_7_b.fit(features_train,target_train)
# Make prediction using test component
prediction_b = model_depth_7_b.predict(features_test)

# Print the recall score for the balanced model
print(recall_score(target_test,prediction_b))
    0.9365256124721604

# Print the ROC/AUC score for the balanced model
print(roc_auc_score(target_test,prediction_b))
    0.958620449994846
