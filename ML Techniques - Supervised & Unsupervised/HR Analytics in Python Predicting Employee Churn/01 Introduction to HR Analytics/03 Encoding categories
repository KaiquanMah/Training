You need to help your algorithm understand that you're dealing with categories. You will encode categories of the salary variable, which you know is ordinal based on the values you observed:

you first have to tell Python that the salary column is actually categorical
you then have to specify the correct order of categories
finally, you should encode each category with a numeric value corresponding to its specific position in the order


# Change the type of the "salary" column to categorical
data.salary = data.salary.astype('category')

# Provide the correct order of categories
data.salary = data.salary.cat.reorder_categories(['low', 'medium', 'high'])

# Encode categories
data.salary = data.salary.cat.codes
