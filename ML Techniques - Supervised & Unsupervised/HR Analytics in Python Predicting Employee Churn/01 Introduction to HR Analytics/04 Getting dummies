You will now transform the department variable, which you know is nominal based on the values you observed. To do that, you will use so-called dummy variables.



# Get dummies and save them inside a new DataFrame
departments = pd.get_dummies(data.department)

# Take a quick look to the first 5 rows of the new DataFrame called departments
print(departments.head())

There are 10 departments in the dataset, so you now get 10 columns. The first five rows in your dataset refer to people working in the non-technical department, so you get values equal to 1 in the department column, and values equal to 0 in the others.
