Remember from the previous exercise that:

Ordinal variables have two or more categories which can be ranked or ordered
Nominal variables have two or more categories which do not have an intrinsic order
In your dataset:

salary is an ordinal variable
department is a nominal variable
In this exercise, you're going to observe the categorical variables found in the previous exercise. To do that, first of all, you will import the pandas library and read the CSV file called "turnover.csv". Then, you will print the unique values of those variables.


# Import pandas (as pd) to read the data
import pandas as pd

# Read "turnover.csv" file and save it in a DataFrame called data
data = pd.read_csv('turnover.csv')

# Print the unique values of the "department" column
print(data.department.unique())
    ['sales' 'accounting' 'hr' 'technical' 'support' 'management' 'IT'
     'product_mng' 'marketing' 'RandD']


# Print the unique values of the "salary" column
print(data.salary.unique())
    ['low' 'medium' 'high']
