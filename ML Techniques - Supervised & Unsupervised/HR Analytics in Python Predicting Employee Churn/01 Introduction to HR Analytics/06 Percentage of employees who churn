The column churn is providing information about whether an employee has left the company or not is the column churn:

if the value of this column is 0, the employee is still with the company
if the value of this column is 1, then the employee has left the company
Letâ€™s calculate the turnover rate:

you will first count the number of times the variable churn has the value 1 and the value 0, respectively
you will then divide both counts by the total, and multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage of employees who left and stayed



# Use len() function to get the total number of observations and save it as the number of employees
n_employees = len(data)

# Print the number of employees who left/stayed
print(data.churn.value_counts())
    0    11428
    1     3571
    Name: churn, dtype: int64
    
    
# Print the percentage of employees who left/stayed
print(data.churn.value_counts()/n_employees*100)
    0    76.191746
    1    23.808254
    Name: churn, dtype: float64
    
11,428 employees stayed, which accounts for about 76% of the total employee count. Similarly, 3,571 employees left, which accounts for about 24% of them.
