Images as data: visualizations
To display image data, you will rely on Python's Matplotlib library, and specifically use matplotlib's pyplot sub-module, that contains many plotting commands. Some of these commands allow you to display the content of images stored in arrays.


# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the image
data = plt.imread('bricks.png')

# Display the image
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()







Images as data: changing images
To modify an image, you can modify the existing numbers in the array. In a color image, you can change the values in one of the color channels without affecting the other colors, by indexing on the last dimension of the array.

The image you imported in the previous exercise is available in data.


# Set the red channel in this part of the image to 1
data[:10,:10,0] = 1

# Set the green channel in this part of the image to 0
#i.e. red and blue -> violet
data[:10,:10,1] = 0

# Set the blue channel in this part of the image to 0
#i.e. only red left
data[:10,:10,2] = 0

# Visualize the result
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()



You now know how to manipulate images. By the way, if you set both the green and red channels to 1, that part of the image would be yellow.
