As motivation for the next and final chapter on support vector machines, we'll repeat the previous exercise with a non-linear SVM. Once again, the data is loaded into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test .

Instead of using LinearSVC, we'll now use scikit-learn's SVC object, which is a non-linear "kernel" SVM (much more on what this means in Chapter 4!). Again, your task is to create a plot of the binary classifier for class 1 vs. rest.



# We'll use SVC instead of LinearSVC from now on
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Create/plot the binary classifier (class 1 vs. rest)
svm_class_1 = SVC()
svm_class_1.fit(X_train, y_train==1)
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, svm_class_1)

Cool, eh?! The non-linear SVM works fine with one-vs-rest on this dataset because it learns to "surround" class 1.
