In this exercise, you'll visualize the examples that the logistic regression model is most and least confident about by looking at the largest and smallest predicted probabilities.

The handwritten digits dataset is already loaded into the variables X and y. The show_digit function takes in an integer index and plots the corresponding image, with some extra information displayed above the image.




lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(X,y)

# Get predicted probabilities
proba = lr.predict_proba(X)

# Sort the example indices by their maximum probability
proba_inds = np.argsort(np.max(proba,axis=1))

# Show the most confident (least ambiguous) digit
show_digit(proba_inds[-1], lr)

# Show the least confident (most ambiguous) digit
show_digit(proba_inds[0], lr)



array([0.99988134, 0.99944832, 0.91673529, ..., 0.99841125, 0.97870776,
       0.9999917 ])
       
       
       As you can see, the least confident example looks like a weird 4, and the most confident example looks like a very typical 0.
