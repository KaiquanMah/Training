In Chapter 1, you used logistic regression on the handwritten digits data set. Here, we'll explore the effect of L2 regularization.

The handwritten digits dataset is already loaded, split, and stored in the variables X_train, y_train, X_valid, and y_valid. The variables train_errs and valid_errs are already initialized as empty lists.






# Train and validaton errors initialized as empty list
train_errs = list()
valid_errs = list()

# Loop over values of C_value
for C_value in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]:
    # Create LogisticRegression object and fit
    lr = LogisticRegression(C=C_value)
    lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate error rates and append to lists
    train_errs.append( 1.0 - lr.score(X_train, y_train) )
    valid_errs.append( 1.0 - lr.score(X_valid, y_valid) )
    
# Plot results
plt.semilogx(C_values, train_errs, C_values, valid_errs)
plt.legend(("train", "validation"))
plt.show()

As you can see, too much regularization (small C) doesn't work well - due to underfitting - and too little regularization (large C) doesn't work well either - due to overfitting.
