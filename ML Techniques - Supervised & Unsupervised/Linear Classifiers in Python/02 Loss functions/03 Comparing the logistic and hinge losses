In this exercise you'll create a plot of the logistic and hinge losses using their mathematical expressions, which are provided to you.

The loss function diagram from the video is shown on the right.




# Mathematical functions for logistic and hinge losses
def log_loss(raw_model_output):
   return np.log(1+np.exp(-raw_model_output))
def hinge_loss(raw_model_output):
   return np.maximum(0,1-raw_model_output)

# Create a grid of values and plot
grid = np.linspace(-2,2,1000)
plt.plot(grid, log_loss(grid), label='logistic')
plt.plot(grid, hinge_loss(grid), label='hinge')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
