In this exercise you'll explore a subset of the Large Movie Review Dataset. The variables X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test are already loaded into the environment. The X variables contain features based on the words in the movie reviews, and the y variables contain labels for whether the review sentiment is positive (+1) or negative (-1).

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Create and fit the model
knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test features, print the results
pred = knn.predict(X_test[0])
print("Prediction for test example 0:", pred)

    Prediction for test example 0: [1.]
