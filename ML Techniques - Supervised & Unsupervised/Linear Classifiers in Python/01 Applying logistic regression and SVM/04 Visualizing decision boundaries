In this exercise, you'll visualize the decision boundaries of various classifier types.

A subset of scikit-learn's built-in wine dataset is already loaded into X, along with binary labels in y.




from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Define the classifiers
classifiers = [LogisticRegression(),SVC(), LinearSVC(),KNeighborsClassifier()]



# Fit the classifiers
for c in classifiers:
    c.fit(X, y)


#Call the plot_4_classifers() function (similar to the code here), passing in X, y, and a list containing the four classifiers.
#https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_iris_svc.html
# Plot the classifiers
plot_4_classifiers(X, y, classifiers)
plt.show()


Nice! As you can see, logistic regression and linear SVM are linear classifiers whereas the default SVM and KNN are not.
