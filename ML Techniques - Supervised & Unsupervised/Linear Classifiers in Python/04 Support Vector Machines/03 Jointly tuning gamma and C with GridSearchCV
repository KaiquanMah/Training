In the previous exercise the best value of gamma was 0.001 using the default value of C, which is 1. In this exercise you'll search for the best combination of C and gamma using GridSearchCV.

As in the previous exercise, the 2-vs-not-2 digits dataset is already loaded, but this time it's split into the variables X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test. Even though cross-validation already splits the training set into parts, it's often a good idea to hold out a separate test set to make sure the cross-validation results are sensible.



# Instantiate an RBF SVM
svm = SVC()

# Instantiate the GridSearchCV object and run the search
parameters = {'C':[0.1, 1, 10], 'gamma':[0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1]}
searcher = GridSearchCV(svm, parameters)
searcher.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Report the best parameters and the corresponding score
print("Best CV params", searcher.best_params_)
print("Best CV accuracy", searcher.best_score_)

# Report the test accuracy using these best parameters
print("Test accuracy of best grid search hypers:", searcher.score(X_test, y_test))
