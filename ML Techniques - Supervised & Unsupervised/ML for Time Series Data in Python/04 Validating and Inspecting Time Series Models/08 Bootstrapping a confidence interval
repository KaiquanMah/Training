A useful tool for assessing the variability of some data is the bootstrap. In this exercise, you'll write your own bootstrapping function that can be used to return a bootstrapped confidence interval.

This function takes three parameters: a 2-D array of numbers (data), a list of percentiles to calculate (percentiles), and the number of boostrap iterations to use (n_boots). It uses the resample function to generate a bootstrap sample, and then repeats this many times to calculate the confidence interval.





from sklearn.utils import resample

def bootstrap_interval(data, percentiles=(2.5, 97.5), n_boots=100):
    """Bootstrap a confidence interval for the mean of columns of a 2-D dataset."""
    # Create our empty array to fill the results
    bootstrap_means = np.zeros([n_boots, data.shape[-1]])
    for ii in range(n_boots):
        # Generate random indices for our data *with* replacement, then take the sample mean
        random_sample = resample(data)
        bootstrap_means[ii] = random_sample.mean(axis=0)
        
    # Compute the percentiles of choice for the bootstrapped means
    percentiles = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, percentiles, axis=0)
    return percentiles
