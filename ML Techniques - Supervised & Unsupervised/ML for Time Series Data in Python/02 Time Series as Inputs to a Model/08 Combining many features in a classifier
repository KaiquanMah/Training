You've spent this lesson engineering many features from the audio data - some contain information about how the audio changes in time, others contain information about the spectral content that is present.

The beauty of machine learning is that it can handle all of these features at the same time. If there is different information present in each feature, it should improve the classifier's ability to distinguish the types of audio. Note that this often requires more advanced techniques such as regularization, which we'll cover in the next chapter.

For the final exercise in the chapter, we've loaded many of the features that you calculated before. Combine all of them into an array that can be fed into the classifier, and see how it does.





# Loop through each spectrogram
bandwidths = []
centroids = []

for spec in spectrograms:
    # Calculate the mean spectral bandwidth
    this_mean_bandwidth = np.mean(lr.feature.spectral_bandwidth(S=spec))
    # Calculate the mean spectral centroid
    this_mean_centroid = np.mean(lr.feature.spectral_centroid(S=spec))
    # Collect the values
    bandwidths.append(this_mean_bandwidth)  
    centroids.append(this_mean_centroid)
    
    

# Create X and y arrays
X = np.column_stack([means, stds, maxs, tempo_mean, tempo_max, tempo_std, bandwidths, centroids])
y = labels.reshape([-1, 1])

#Score the classifier with cross-validation.
# Fit the model and score on testing data
percent_score = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
print(np.mean(percent_score))

You calculated many different features of the audio, and combined each of them under the assumption that they provide independent information that can be used in classification. You may have noticed that the accuracy of your models varied a lot when using different set of features. This chapter was focused on creating new "features" from raw data and not obtaining the best accuracy. To improve the accuracy, you want to find the right features that provide relevant information and also build models on much larger data.
