Spectral engineering is one of the most common techniques in machine learning for time series data. The first step in this process is to calculate a spectrogram of sound. This describes what spectral content (e.g., low and high pitches) are present in the sound over time. In this exercise, you'll calculate a spectrogram of a heartbeat audio file.
We've loaded a single heartbeat sound in the variable audio.


#Import the short-time fourier transform (stft) function from librosa.core.
# Import the stft function
from librosa.core import stft

# Prepare the STFT
HOP_LENGTH = 2**4
spec = stft(audio, hop_length=HOP_LENGTH, n_fft=2**7)



from librosa.core import amplitude_to_db
from librosa.display import specshow

# Convert into decibels
spec_db = amplitude_to_db(spec)

# Compare the raw audio to the spectrogram of the audio
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 10), sharex=True)
axs[0].plot(time, audio)
specshow(spec_db, sr=sfreq, x_axis='time', y_axis='hz', hop_length=HOP_LENGTH)
plt.show()

Do you notice that the heartbeats come in pairs, as seen by the vertical lines in the spectrogram?
