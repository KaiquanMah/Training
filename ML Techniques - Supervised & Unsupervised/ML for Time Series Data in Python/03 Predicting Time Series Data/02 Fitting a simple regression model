Now we'll look at a larger number of companies. Recall that we have historical price values for many companies. Let's use data from several companies to predict the value of a test company. You'll attempt to predict the value of the Apple stock price using the values of NVidia, Ebay, and Yahoo. Each of these is stored as a column in the all_prices DataFrame. Below is a mapping from company name to column name:

ebay: "EBAY"
nvidia: "NVDA"
yahoo: "YHOO"
apple: "AAPL"
We'll use these columns to define the input/output arrays in our model.



from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Use stock symbols to extract training data
X = all_prices[["EBAY","NVDA","YHOO"]]
y = all_prices[["AAPL"]]

# Fit and score the model with cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(Ridge(), X, y, cv=3)
print(scores)
    [-6.09050633 -0.3179172  -3.72957284]
