In this exercise, you'll handle outliers - data points that are so different from the rest of your data, that you treat them differently from other "normal-looking" data points. You'll use the output from the previous exercise (percent change over time) to detect the outliers. First you will write a function that replaces outlier data points with the median value from the entire time series.




def replace_outliers(series):
    # Calculate the absolute difference of each timepoint from the series mean
    absolute_differences_from_mean = np.abs(series - np.mean(series))
    
    # Calculate a mask for the differences that are > 3 standard deviations from zero
    this_mask = absolute_differences_from_mean > (np.std(series) * 3)
    
    # Replace these values with the median accross the data
    series[this_mask] = np.nanmedian(series)
    return series

# Apply your preprocessing function to the timeseries and plot the results
prices_perc = prices_perc.apply(replace_outliers)
prices_perc.loc["2014":"2015"].plot()
plt.show()
