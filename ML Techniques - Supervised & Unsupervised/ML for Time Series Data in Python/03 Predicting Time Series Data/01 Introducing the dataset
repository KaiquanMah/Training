As mentioned in the video, you'll deal with stock market prices that fluctuate over time. In this exercise you've got historical prices from two tech companies (Ebay and Yahoo) in the DataFrame prices. You'll visualize the raw data for the two companies, then generate a scatter plot showing how the values for each company compare with one another. Finally, you'll add in a "time" dimension to your scatter plot so you can see how this relationship changes over time.

The data has been loaded into a DataFrame called prices.


# Plot the raw values over time
prices.plot()
plt.show()

#Generate a scatter plot with the values of Ebay on the x-axis, and Yahoo on the y-axis. Look up the symbols for both companies from the column names of the DataFrame.
# Scatterplot with one company per axis
prices.plot.scatter(x='EBAY', y='YHOO')
plt.show()

# Scatterplot with color relating to time
prices.plot.scatter('EBAY', 'YHOO', c=prices.index, 
                    cmap=plt.cm.viridis, colorbar=False)
plt.show()


As you can see, these two time series seem somewhat related to each other, though its a complex relationship that changes over time.
