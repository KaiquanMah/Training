In this exercise, you'll practice how to pre-choose arguments of a function so that you can pre-configure how it runs. You'll use this to calculate several percentiles of your data using the same percentile() function in numpy.



# Import partial from functools
from functools import partial
percentiles = [1, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 99]

# Use a list comprehension to create a partial function for each quantile
percentile_functions = [partial(np.percentile, q=percentile) for percentile in percentiles]

# Calculate each of these quantiles on the data using a rolling window
prices_perc_rolling = prices_perc.rolling(20, min_periods=5, closed='right')
features_percentiles = prices_perc_rolling.aggregate(percentile_functions)

# Plot a subset of the result
ax = features_percentiles.loc[:"2011-01"].plot(cmap=plt.cm.viridis)
ax.legend(percentiles, loc=(1.01, .5))
plt.show()
