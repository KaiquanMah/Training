Plotting a time series (I)
In this exercise, you'll practice plotting the values of two time series without the time component.
Two DataFrames, data and data2 are available in your workspace.
Unless otherwise noted, assume that all required packages are loaded with their common aliases throughout this course.
Note: This course assumes some familiarity with time series data, as well as how to use them in data analytics pipelines. For an introduction to time series, we recommend the Introduction to Time Series Analysis in Python and Visualizing Time Series Data with Python courses.


# Print the first 5 rows of data
print(data.head())

<script.py> output:
    symbol  data_values
    0        214.009998
    1        214.379993
    2        210.969995
    3        210.580000
    4        211.980005
    
    
# Print the first 5 rows of data2
print(data2.head())

<script.py> output:
       data_values
    0    -0.006928
    1    -0.007929
    2    -0.008900
    3    -0.009815
    4    -0.010653
    
    
    
# Plot the time series in each dataset
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(5, 10))
data.iloc[:1000].plot(y='data_values', ax=axs[0])
data2.iloc[:1000].plot(y='data_values', ax=axs[1])
plt.show()

    






Plotting a time series (II)
You'll now plot both the datasets again, but with the included time stamps for each (stored in the column called "time"). Let's see if this gives you some more context for understanding each time series data.




# Plot the time series in each dataset
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(5, 10))
data.iloc[:1000].plot(x="time", y="data_values", ax=axs[0])
data2.iloc[:1000].plot(x="time", y="data_values", ax=axs[1])
plt.show()

 As you can now see, each time series has a very different sampling frequency (the amount of time between samples). The first is daily stock market data, and the second is an audio waveform.
