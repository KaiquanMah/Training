Kidney disease case study I: Categorical Imputer
You'll now continue your exploration of using pipelines with a dataset that requires significantly more wrangling. The chronic kidney disease dataset contains both categorical and numeric features, but contains lots of missing values. The goal here is to predict who has chronic kidney disease given various blood indicators as features.
As Sergey mentioned in the video, you'll be introduced to a new library, sklearn_pandas, that allows you to chain many more processing steps inside of a pipeline than are currently supported in scikit-learn. Specifically, you'll be able to impute missing categorical values directly using the Categorical_Imputer() class in sklearn_pandas, and the DataFrameMapper() class to apply any arbitrary sklearn-compatible transformer on DataFrame columns, where the resulting output can be either a NumPy array or DataFrame.
We've also created a transformer called a Dictifier that encapsulates converting a DataFrame using .to_dict("records") without you having to do it explicitly (and so that it works in a pipeline). Finally, we've also provided the list of feature names in kidney_feature_names, the target name in kidney_target_name, the features in X, and the target in y.
In this exercise, your task is to apply the CategoricalImputer to impute all of the categorical columns in the dataset. You can refer to how the numeric imputation mapper was created as a template. Notice the keyword arguments input_df=True and df_out=True? This is so that you can work with DataFrames instead of arrays. By default, the transformers are passed a numpy array of the selected columns as input, and as a result, the output of the DataFrame mapper is also an array. Scikit-learn transformers have historically been designed to work with numpy arrays, not pandas DataFrames, even though their basic indexing interfaces are similar.



# Import necessary modules
from sklearn_pandas import DataFrameMapper
from sklearn_pandas import CategoricalImputer

# Check number of nulls in each feature column
nulls_per_column = X.isnull().sum()
print(nulls_per_column)

# Create a boolean mask for categorical columns
categorical_feature_mask = X.dtypes == object

# Get list of categorical column names
categorical_columns = X.columns[categorical_feature_mask].tolist()

# Get list of non-categorical column names
non_categorical_columns = X.columns[~categorical_feature_mask].tolist()

# Apply numeric imputer
numeric_imputation_mapper = DataFrameMapper(
                                            [([numeric_feature], Imputer(strategy="median")) for numeric_feature in non_categorical_columns],
                                            input_df=True,
                                            df_out=True
                                           )



#Apply the categorical imputer using DataFrameMapper() and CategoricalImputer(). CategoricalImputer() does not need any arguments to be passed in. The columns are contained in categorical_columns. Be sure to specify input_df=True and df_out=True, and use category_feature as your iterator variable in the list comprehension.
# Apply categorical imputer
categorical_imputation_mapper = DataFrameMapper(
                                                [(category_feature, CategoricalImputer) for category_feature in categorical_columns],
                                                input_df=True,
                                                df_out=True
                                               )
                                               







Part 2
Kidney disease case study II: Feature Union
Having separately imputed numeric as well as categorical columns, your task is now to use scikit-learn's FeatureUnion to concatenate their results, which are contained in two separate transformer objects - numeric_imputation_mapper, and categorical_imputation_mapper, respectively.
You may have already encountered FeatureUnion in Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets. Just like with pipelines, you have to pass it a list of (string, transformer) tuples, where the first half of each tuple is the name of the transformer.

# Import FeatureUnion
from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion

# Combine the numeric and categorical transformations
numeric_categorical_union = FeatureUnion([
                                          ("cat_mapper", categorical_imputation_mapper),
                                          ("num_mapper", numeric_imputation_mapper)
                                         ])
                                         






Part 3
Kidney disease case study III: Full pipeline
It's time to piece together all of the transforms along with an XGBClassifier to build the full pipeline!
Besides the numeric_categorical_union that you created in the previous exercise, there are two other transforms needed: the Dictifier() transform which we created for you, and the DictVectorizer().
After creating the pipeline, your task is to cross-validate it to see how well it performs.

#Create the pipeline using the numeric_categorical_union, Dictifier(), and DictVectorizer(sort=False) transforms, and xgb.XGBClassifier() estimator with max_depth=3. Name the transforms "featureunion", "dictifier" "vectorizer", and the estimator "clf".
# Create full pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
                     ("featureunion", numeric_categorical_union),
                     ("dictifier", Dictifier()),
                     ("vectorizer", DictVectorizer(sort=False)),
                     ("clf", xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=3))
                    ])


#Perform 3-fold cross-validation on the pipeline using cross_val_score(). Pass it the pipeline, pipeline, the features, kidney_data, the outcomes, y. Also set scoring to "roc_auc" and cv to 3.
# Perform cross-validation
cross_val_scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, scoring="roc_auc", cv=3)

# Print avg. AUC
print("3-fold AUC: ", np.mean(cross_val_scores))

    3-fold AUC:  0.998637406769937
