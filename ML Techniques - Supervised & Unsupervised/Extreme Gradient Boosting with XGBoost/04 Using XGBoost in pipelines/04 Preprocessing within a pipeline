Now that you've seen what steps need to be taken individually to properly process the Ames housing data, let's use the much cleaner and more succinct DictVectorizer approach and put it alongside an XGBoostRegressor inside of a scikit-learn pipeline.




# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer
from sklearn.pipeline import DictVectorizer

# Fill LotFrontage missing values with 0
X.LotFrontage = X.LotFrontage.fillna(0)

# Setup the pipeline steps: steps
steps = [("ohe_onestep", DictVectorizer(sparse=False)),
         ("xgb_model", xgb.XGBRegressor())]

# Create the pipeline: xgb_pipeline
xgb_pipeline = Pipeline(steps)


#Fit the Pipeline. Don't forget to convert X into a format that DictVectorizer understands by calling the to_dict("records") method on X.
# Fit the pipeline
xgb_pipeline.fit(X.to_dict("records"))
