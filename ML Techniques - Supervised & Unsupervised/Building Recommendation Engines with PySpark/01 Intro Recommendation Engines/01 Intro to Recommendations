See the power of a recommendation engine
Taylor and Jane both like watching movies. Taylor only likes dramas, comedies, and romances. Jane likes only action, adventure, and otherwise exciting films. One of the greatest benefits of ALS-based recommendation engines is that they can identify movies or items that users will like, even if they themselves think that they might not like them. Take a look at the movie ratings that Taylor and Jane have provided below. It would stand to reason that their different preferences would generate different recommendations.
