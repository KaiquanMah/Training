Matrix Factorisation
Matrix G is provided here as a Pandas dataframe. View it to understand what it looks like. Look at the possible factor matrices H, I, and J (also Pandas dataframes), and determine which two matrices will produce the matrix G when multiplied together.



# Take a look at Matrix G using the following print function
print("Matrix G:")
print(G)
Matrix G:
   0  1
0  6  6
1  3  3


# Take a look at the matrices H, I, and J and determine which pair of those matrices will produce G when multiplied together. 
print("Matrix H:")
print(H)
Matrix H:
   0  1
0  2  2
1  1  1


print("Matrix I:")
print(I)
Matrix I:
   0  1
0  3  3
1  3  3


print("Matrix J:")
print(J)
Matrix J:
   0  1
0  1  1
1  2  2


# Multiply the two matrices that are factors of the matrix G
prod = np.matmul(H,J)
print(G == prod)



          0     1
    0  True  True
    1  True  True
