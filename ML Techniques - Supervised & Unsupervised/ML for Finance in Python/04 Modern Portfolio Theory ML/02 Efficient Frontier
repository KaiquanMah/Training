Plot efficient frontier
We can finally plot the results of our MPT portfolios, which shows the "efficient frontier". This is a plot of the volatility vs the returns. This can help us visualize our risk-return possibilities for portfolios. The upper left boundary of the points is the best we can do (highest return for a given risk), and that is the efficient frontier.

To create this plot, we will use the latest date in our covariances dictionary which we created a few exercises ago. This has dates as keys, so we'll get the sorted keys using sorted() and .keys(), then get the last entry with Python indexing ([-1]). Lastly we'll use matplotlib to scatter variance vs returns and see the efficient frontier for the latest date in the data.




# Get latest date of available data
date = sorted(covariances.keys())[-1]  

# Plot efficient frontier
# warning: this can take at least 10s for the plot to execute...
plt.scatter(x=portfolio_volatility[date], y=portfolio_returns[date],  alpha=0.1)
plt.xlabel('Volatility')
plt.ylabel('Returns')
plt.show()


Often the efficient frontier will be a bullet shape, but if the returns are all positive then it may look like this (positively sloped).
