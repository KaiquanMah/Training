In previous exercises, you pulled data from tables, then summarized the resulting data frames in pandas to create graphs. By using COUNT and GROUP BY in a SQL query, we can pull those summary figures from the database directly.
The hpd311calls table has a column, complaint_type, that categorizes call records by issue, such as heating or plumbing. In order to graph call volumes by issue, you'll write a SQL query that COUNTs records by complaint type.
pandas has been imported as pd, and the database engine for data.db has been created as engine.


Create a SQL query that gets the complaint_type column and counts of all records from hpd311calls, grouped by complaint_type.
Create a data frame with read_sql() of call counts by issue, calls_by_issue.
Run the last section of code to graph the number of calls for each housing issue.


# Create query to get call counts by complaint_type
query = """
SELECT complaint_type, 
     COUNT(*)
  FROM hpd311calls
  GROUP BY complaint_type;
"""

# Create data frame of call counts by issue
calls_by_issue = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Graph the number of calls for each housing issue
calls_by_issue.plot.barh(x="complaint_type")
plt.show()




#Calls about heat and hot water issues vastly outnumber calls about all other issues. The data subset in the table comes from the winter, so this makes sense. We'll explore these calls more in the next lesson.
calls_by_issue.sort_values(by = ['COUNT(*)'])
