Sometimes an analysis doesn't need every record, but rather unique values in one or more columns. Duplicate values can be removed after loading data into a data frame, but it can also be done at import with SQL's DISTINCT keyword.
Since hpd311calls contains data about housing issues, we would expect most records to have a borough listed. Let's test this assumption by querying unique complaint_type/borough combinations.
pandas has been imported as pd, and the database engine has been created as engine.
Note: The SQL checker is quite picky about column positions and expects fields to be selected in the specified order.


Create a query that gets DISTINCT values for borough and complaint_type (in that order) from hpd311calls.
Use read_sql() to load the results of the query to a data frame, issues_and_boros.
Print the data frame to check if the assumption that all issues besides literature requests appear with boroughs listed.



# Create query for unique combinations of borough and complaint_type
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT borough, 
       complaint_type
  FROM hpd311calls;
"""

# Load results of query to a data frame
issues_and_boros = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Check assumption about issues and boroughs
print(issues_and_boros)

#Looks like the only issues with no borough are requests for information, rather than housing complaints, which is okay. SELECT DISTINCT queries can be an easy way to find data quality issues like misspelled values or combinations of values that violate assumptions.
