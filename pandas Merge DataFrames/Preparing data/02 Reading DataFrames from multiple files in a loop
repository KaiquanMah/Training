# As you saw in the video, loading data from multiple files into DataFrames is more efficient in a loop or a list comprehension.
# Notice that this approach is not restricted to working with CSV files. That is, even if your data comes in other formats, as long as pandas has a suitable data import function, you can apply a loop or comprehension to generate a list of DataFrames imported from the source files.
# Here, you'll continue working with The Guardian's Olympic medal dataset.



# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create the list of file names: filenames
filenames = ['Gold.csv', 'Silver.csv', 'Bronze.csv']

# Create the list of three DataFrames: dataframes
dataframes = []
for filename in filenames:
    dataframes.append(pd.read_csv(filename))

# Print top 5 rows of 1st DataFrame in dataframes
print(dataframes[0].head())
