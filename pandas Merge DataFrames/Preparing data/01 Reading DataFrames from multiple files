# When data is spread among several files, you usually invoke pandas' read_csv() (or a similar data import function) multiple times to load the data into several DataFrames.
# The data files for this example have been derived from a list of Olympic medals awarded between 1896 & 2008 compiled by the Guardian.
# https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jun/25/olympic-medal-winner-list-data
# The column labels of each DataFrame are NOC, Country, & Total where NOC is a three-letter code for the name of the country and Total is the number of medals of that type won (bronze, silver, or gold).
# This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Pandas Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read 'Bronze.csv' into a DataFrame: bronze
bronze = pd.read_csv('Bronze.csv')

# Read 'Silver.csv' into a DataFrame: silver
silver = pd.read_csv('Silver.csv')

# Read 'Gold.csv' into a DataFrame: gold
gold = pd.read_csv('Gold.csv')

# Print the first five rows of gold
print(gold.head())
