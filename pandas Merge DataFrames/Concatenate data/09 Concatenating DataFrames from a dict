# You're now going to revisit the sales data you worked with earlier in the chapter. Three DataFrames jan, feb, and mar have been pre-loaded for you. Your task is to aggregate the sum of all sales over the 'Company' column into a single DataFrame. You'll do this by constructing a dictionary of these DataFrames and then concatenating them.



# Make the list of tuples: month_list
month_list = [('january', jan), ('february', feb), ('march', mar)]

# Create an empty dictionary: month_dict
month_dict = {}

for month_name, month_data in month_list:

    # Group month_data: month_dict[month_name]
    # Group month_data by 'Company' and use .sum() to aggregate.
    month_dict[month_name] = month_data.groupby('Company').sum()

# Concatenate data in month_dict: sales
#Construct a new DataFrame called sales by concatenating the DataFrames stored in month_dict.
sales = pd.concat(month_dict)

# Print sales
print(sales)

# Print all sales by Mediacore
#Create an alias for pd.IndexSlice and print all sales by 'Mediacore'.
idx = pd.IndexSlice
print(sales.loc[idx[:, 'Mediacore'], :])
