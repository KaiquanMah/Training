# It is also possible to construct a DataFrame with hierarchically indexed columns. For this exercise, you'll start with pandas imported and a list of three DataFrames called dataframes. All three DataFrames contain 'Company', 'Product', and 'Units' columns with a 'Date' column as the index pertaining to sales transactions during the month of February, 2015. The first DataFrame describes Hardware transactions, the second describes Software transactions, and the third, Service transactions.
# Your task is to concatenate the DataFrames horizontally and to create a MultiIndex on the columns. From there, you can summarize the resulting DataFrame and slice some information from it.



# Concatenate dataframes: february
# Use axis=1 to stack the DataFrames horizontally and the keyword argument keys=['Hardware', 'Software', 'Service'] to construct a hierarchical Index from each DataFrame.
february = pd.concat(dataframes, keys=['Hardware', 'Software', 'Service'], axis='columns')

# Print february.info()
print(february.info())

# Assign pd.IndexSlice: idx
idx = pd.IndexSlice

# Create the slice: slice_2_8
slice_2_8 = february.loc['2015-02-02':'2015-02-08', idx[:, 'Company']]

# Print slice_2_8
print(slice_2_8)
