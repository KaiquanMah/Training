# The function pd.concat() can concatenate DataFrames horizontally as well as vertically (vertical is the default). To make the DataFrames stack horizontally, you have to specify the keyword argument axis=1 or axis='columns'.
# In this exercise, you'll use weather data with maximum and mean daily temperatures sampled at different rates (quarterly versus monthly). You'll concatenate the rows of both and see that, where rows are missing in the coarser DataFrame, null values are inserted in the concatenated DataFrame. This corresponds to an outer join (which you will explore in more detail in later exercises).
# The files 'quarterly_max_temp.csv' and 'monthly_mean_temp.csv' have been pre-loaded into the DataFrames weather_max and weather_mean respectively, and pandas has been imported as pd.


# Create a list of weather_max and weather_mean
weather_list = [weather_max, weather_mean]

# Concatenate weather_list horizontally
weather = pd.concat(weather_list, axis='columns')

# Print weather
print(weather)
