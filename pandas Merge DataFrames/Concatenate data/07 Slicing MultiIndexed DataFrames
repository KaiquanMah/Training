# This exercise picks up where the last ended (again using The Guardian's Olympic medal dataset).
# You are provided with the MultiIndexed DataFrame as produced at the end of the preceding exercise. Your task is to sort the DataFrame and to use the pd.IndexSlice to extract specific slices. Check out this exercise from Manipulating DataFrames with pandas to refresh your memory on how to deal with MultiIndexed DataFrames.
# pandas has been imported for you as pd and the DataFrame medals is already in your namespace.



# Sort the entries of medals: medals_sorted
medals_sorted = medals.sort_index(level=0)

# Print the number of Bronze medals won by Germany
print(medals_sorted.loc[('bronze','Germany')])

# Print data about silver medals
print(medals_sorted.loc['silver'])

# Create alias for pd.IndexSlice: idx
#Create an alias for pd.IndexSlice called idx. A slicer pd.IndexSlice is required when slicing on the inner level of a MultiIndex.
idx = pd.IndexSlice

# Print all the data on medals won by the United Kingdom
# outer index - everything; inner index - ONLY UK; all cols
# [idx[:,'United Kingdom'], :]
print(medals_sorted.loc[idx[:,'United Kingdom'], :])
