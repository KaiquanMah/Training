# Here, you'll continue working with DataFrames compiled from The Guardian's Olympic medal dataset.
# The DataFrames bronze, silver, and gold have been pre-loaded for you.
# Your task is to compute an inner join.



# Create the list of DataFrames: medal_list
medal_list = [bronze,silver,gold]

# Concatenate medal_list horizontally using an inner join: medals
#Use the keyword argument keys=['bronze', 'silver', 'gold'] to yield suitable hierarchical indexing.
#Use axis=1 to get horizontal concatenation.
#Use join='inner' to keep only rows that share common index labels.
medals = pd.concat(medal_list,keys=['bronze', 'silver', 'gold'],axis='columns',join='inner')

# Print medals
print(medals)
