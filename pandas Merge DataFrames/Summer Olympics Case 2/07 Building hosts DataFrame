# Your task here is to prepare a DataFrame hosts by left joining editions and ioc_codes.
# Once created, you will subset the Edition and NOC columns and set Edition as the Index.
# There are some missing NOC values; you will set those explicitly.
# Finally, you'll reset the Index & print the final DataFrame.


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Left join editions and ioc_codes: hosts
hosts = pd.merge(editions,ioc_codes,how='left')

# Extract relevant columns and set index: hosts
hosts = hosts[['Edition', 'NOC']].set_index('Edition')

# Fix missing 'NOC' values of hosts
print(hosts.loc[hosts.NOC.isnull()])
hosts.loc[1972, 'NOC'] = 'FRG'
hosts.loc[1980, 'NOC'] = 'URS'
hosts.loc[1988, 'NOC'] = 'KOR'

# Reset Index of hosts: hosts
hosts = hosts.reset_index()

# Print hosts
print(hosts)
