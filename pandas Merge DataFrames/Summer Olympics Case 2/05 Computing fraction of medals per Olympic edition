#  In this exercise, you'll start with the DataFrames editions, medals, & medal_counts from prior exercises.
# You can extract a Series with the total number of medals awarded in each Olympic edition.
# The DataFrame medal_counts can be divided row-wise by the total number of medals awarded each edition; the method .divide() performs the broadcast as you require.
# This gives you a normalized indication of each country's performance in each edition.




# Set Index of editions: totals
totals = editions.set_index('Edition')

# Reassign totals['Grand Total']: totals
totals = totals['Grand Total']

# Divide medal_counts by totals: fractions
fractions = medal_counts.divide(totals,axis='rows')

# Print first & last 5 rows of fractions
print(fractions.head())
print(fractions.tail())
