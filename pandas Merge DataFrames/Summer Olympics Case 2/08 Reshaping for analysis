# This exercise starts off with fractions_change and hosts already loaded.
# Your task here is to reshape the fractions_change DataFrame for later analysis.
# Initially, fractions_change is a wide DataFrame of 26 rows (one for each Olympic edition) and 139 columns (one for the edition and 138 for the competing countries).
# On reshaping with pd.melt(), as you will see, the result is a tall DataFrame with 3588 rows and 3 columns that summarizes the fractional change in the expanding mean of the percentage of medals won for each country in blocks.




# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Reshape fractions_change: reshaped
#Create a DataFrame reshaped by reshaping the DataFrame fractions_change with pd.melt().
#You'll need to use the keyword argument id_vars='Edition' to set the identifier variable.
#You'll also need to use the keyword argument value_name='Change' to set the measured variables.
reshaped = pd.melt(fractions_change,id_vars='Edition',value_name='Change')

# Print reshaped.shape and fractions_change.shape
print(reshaped.shape, fractions_change.shape)

# Extract rows from reshaped where 'NOC' == 'CHN': chn
chn = reshaped[reshaped.NOC=='CHN']

# Print last 5 rows of chn with .tail()
print(chn.tail())
