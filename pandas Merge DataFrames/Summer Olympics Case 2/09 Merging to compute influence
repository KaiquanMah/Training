# This exercise starts off with the DataFrames reshaped and hosts in the namespace.
# Your task is to merge the two DataFrames and tidy the result.
# The end result is a DataFrame summarizing the fractional change in the expanding mean of the percentage of medals won for the host country in each Olympic edition.




# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Merge reshaped and hosts: merged
merged = pd.merge(reshaped, hosts, how='inner')

# Print first 5 rows of merged
print(merged.head())

# Set Index of merged and sort it: influence
influence = merged.set_index('Edition').sort_index()

# Print first 5 rows of influence
print(influence.head())
