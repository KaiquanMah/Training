# This final exercise starts off with the DataFrames influence and editions in the namespace. Your job is to plot the influence of being a host country.



# Import pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extract influence['Change']: change
#Create a Series called change by extracting the 'Change' column from influence.
change = influence['Change']

# Make bar plot of change: ax
#Create a bar plot of change using the .plot() method with kind='bar'. Save the result as ax to permit further customization.
ax = change.plot(kind='bar')

# Customize the plot to improve readability
ax.set_ylabel("% Change of Host Country Medal Count")
ax.set_title("Is there a Host Country Advantage?")
ax.set_xticklabels(editions['City'])

# Display the plot
plt.show()
