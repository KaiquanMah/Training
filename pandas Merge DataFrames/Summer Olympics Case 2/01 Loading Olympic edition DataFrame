# In this chapter, you'll be using The Guardian's Olympic medal dataset.
# Your first task here is to prepare a DataFrame editions from a tab-separated values (TSV) file.
# Initially, editions has 26 rows (one for each Olympic edition, i.e., a year in which the Olympics was held) and 7 columns: 'Edition', 'Bronze', 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Grand Total', 'City', and 'Country'.
# For the analysis that follows, you won't need the overall medal counts, so you want to keep only the useful columns from editions: 'Edition', 'Grand Total', City, and Country.


#Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create file path: file_path
file_path = 'Summer Olympic medallists 1896 to 2008 - EDITIONS.tsv'

# Load DataFrame from file_path: editions
editions = pd.read_csv(file_path,sep='\t')

# Extract the relevant columns: editions
editions = editions[['Edition', 'Grand Total', 'City', 'Country']]

# Print editions DataFrame
print(editions)
