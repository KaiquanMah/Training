# Here, you'll start with the concatenated DataFrame medals from the previous exercise.
# You can construct a pivot table to see the number of medals each country won in each year. The result is a new DataFrame with the Olympic edition on the Index and with 138 country NOC codes as columns. If you want a refresher on pivot tables, it may be useful to refer back to the relevant exercises in Manipulating DataFrames with pandas.



# Construct the pivot_table: medal_counts
#Construct a pivot table from the DataFrame medals, aggregating by count (by specifying the aggfunc parameter). Use 'Edition' as the index, 'Athlete' for the values, and 'NOC' for the columns.
medal_counts = medals.pivot_table(index='Edition', columns='NOC', values='Athlete', aggfunc='count')

# Print the first & last 5 rows of medal_counts
print(medal_counts.head())
print(medal_counts.tail())
