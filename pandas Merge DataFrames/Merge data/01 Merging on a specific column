# This exercise follows on the last one with the DataFrames revenue and managers for your company. You expect your company to grow and, eventually, to operate in cities with the same name on different states. As such, you decide that every branch should have a numerical branch identifier. Thus, you add a branch_id column to both DataFrames. Moreover, new cities have been added to both the revenue and managers DataFrames as well. pandas has been imported as pd and both DataFrames are available in your namespace.
# At present, there should be a 1-to-1 relationship between the city and branch_id fields. In that case, the result of a merge on the city columns ought to give you the same output as a merge on the branch_id columns. Do they? Can you spot an ambiguity in one of the DataFrames?


# Merge revenue with managers on 'city': merge_by_city
#Using pd.merge(), merge the DataFrames revenue and managers on the 'city' column of each. Store the result as merge_by_city.
merge_by_city = pd.merge(revenue,managers,on='city')

# Print merge_by_city
print(merge_by_city)

# Merge revenue with managers on 'branch_id': merge_by_id
merge_by_id = pd.merge(revenue,managers,on='branch_id')

# Print merge_by_id
print(merge_by_id)
