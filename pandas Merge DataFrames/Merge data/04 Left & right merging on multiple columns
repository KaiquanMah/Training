# You now have, in addition to the revenue and managers DataFrames from prior exercises, a DataFrame sales that summarizes units sold from specific branches (identified by city and state but not branch_id).
# Once again, the managers DataFrame uses the label branch in place of city as in the other two DataFrames. Your task here is to employ left and right merges to preserve data and identify where data is missing.
# By merging revenue and sales with a right merge, you can identify the missing revenue values. Here, you don't need to specify left_on or right_on because the columns to merge on have matching labels.
# By merging sales and managers with a left merge, you can identify the missing manager. Here, the columns to merge on have conflicting labels, so you must specify left_on and right_on. In both cases, you're looking to figure out how to connect the fields in rows containing Springfield.
# pandas has been imported as pd and the three DataFrames revenue, managers, and sales have been pre-loaded. They have been printed for you to explore in the IPython Shell.



# Merge revenue and sales: revenue_and_sales
revenue_and_sales = pd.merge(revenue, sales,on=['city', 'state'],how='right')

# Print revenue_and_sales
print(revenue_and_sales)

# Merge sales and managers: sales_and_managers
sales_and_managers = pd.merge(sales, managers, left_on=['city', 'state'], right_on=['branch', 'state'],how='left')

# Print sales_and_managers
print(sales_and_managers)
