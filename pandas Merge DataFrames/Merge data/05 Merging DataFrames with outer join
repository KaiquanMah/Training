# This exercise picks up where the previous one left off. The DataFrames revenue, managers, and sales are pre-loaded into your namespace (and, of course, pandas is imported as pd). Moreover, the merged DataFrames revenue_and_sales and sales_and_managers have been pre-computed exactly as you did in the previous exercise.
# The merged DataFrames contain enough information to construct a DataFrame with 5 rows with all known information correctly aligned and each branch listed only once. You will try to merge the merged DataFrames on all matching keys (which computes an inner join by default). You can compare the result to an outer join and also to an outer join with restricted subset of columns as keys.


# Perform the first merge: merge_default
# default inner join
merge_default = pd.merge(sales_and_managers, revenue_and_sales)

# Print merge_default
print(merge_default)

# Perform the second merge: merge_outer
merge_outer = pd.merge(sales_and_managers, revenue_and_sales, how='outer')

# Print merge_outer
print(merge_outer)

# Perform the third merge: merge_outer_on
merge_outer_on = pd.merge(sales_and_managers, revenue_and_sales, on=['city','state'],how='outer')

# Print merge_outer_on
print(merge_outer_on)
