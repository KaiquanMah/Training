# Another strategy to disambiguate cities with identical names is to add information on the states in which the cities are located. To this end, you add a column called state to both DataFrames from the preceding exercises. Again, pandas has been pre-imported as pd and the revenue and managers DataFrames are in your namespace.
# Your goal in this exercise is to use pd.merge() to merge DataFrames using multiple columns (using 'branch_id', 'city', and 'state' in this case).
# Are you able to match all your company's branches correctly?



# Add 'state' column to revenue: revenue['state']
revenue['state'] = ['TX','CO','IL','CA']

# Add 'state' column to managers: managers['state']
managers['state'] = ['TX','CO','CA','MO']

# Merge revenue & managers on 'branch_id', 'city', & 'state': combined
combined = pd.merge(revenue,managers,on=['branch_id', 'city', 'state'])

# Print combined
print(combined)
