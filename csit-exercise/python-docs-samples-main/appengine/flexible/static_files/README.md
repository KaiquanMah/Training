This demonstrates how to use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to serve static files in your application.

Flask automatically makes anything in the ``static`` directory available via the ``/static`` URL. If you plan on using a different framework, it may have different conventions for serving static files.

Refer to the [top-level README](../README.md) for instructions on running and deploying.
