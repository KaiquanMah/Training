Reasons for Modeling: Interpolation
One common use of modeling is interpolation to determine a value "inside" or "in between" the measured data points. In this exercise, you will make a prediction for the value of the dependent variable distances for a given independent variable times that falls "in between" two measurements from a road trip, where the distances are those traveled for the given elapse times.





times, distances
[hours], [miles]
 0.0,     0.00
 1.0,    44.05
 2.0,   107.16
 3.0,   148.44
 4.0,   196.40
 5.0,   254.44
 6.0,   300.00
 
 
 
 
 # Compute the total change in distance and change in time
total_distance = distances[-1] - distances[0]
total_time = times[-1] - times[0]

# Estimate the slope of the data from the ratio of the changes
average_speed = total_distance / total_time

# Predict the distance traveled for a time not measured
elapse_time = 2.5
distance_traveled = average_speed * elapse_time
print("The distance traveled is {}".format(distance_traveled))


<script.py> output:
    The distance traveled is 125.0

Notice that the answer distance is 'inside' that range of data values, so, less than the max(distances) but greater than the min(distances)
