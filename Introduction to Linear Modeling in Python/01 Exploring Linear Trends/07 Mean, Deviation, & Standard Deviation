Mean, Deviation, & Standard Deviation
The mean describes the center of the data. The standard deviation describes the spread of the data. But to compare two variables, it is convenient to normalize both. In this exercise, you are provided with two arrays of data, which are highly correlated, and you will compute and visualize the normalized deviations of each array.

# Compute the deviations by subtracting the mean offset
dx = x - np.mean(x)
dy = y - np.mean(y)

# Normalize the data by dividing the deviations by the standard deviation
zx = dx / np.std(x)
zy = dy / np.std(y)

# Plot comparisons of the raw data and the normalized data
fig = plot_cdfs(dx, dy, zx, zy)

Notice how hard it is to compare dx and dy, versus comparing the normalized zx and zy.
