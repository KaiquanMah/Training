Reasons for Modeling: Extrapolation
Another common use of modeling is extrapolation to estimate data values "outside" or "beyond" the range (min and max values of time) of the measured data. In this exercise, we have measured distances for times 0 through 5 hours, but we are interested in estimating how far we'd go in 8 hours. Using the same data set from the previous exercise, we have prepared a linear model distance = model(time). Use that model() to make a prediction about the distance traveled for a time much larger than the other times in the measurements.

time, distance
 0.0,     0.00
 1.0,    44.05
 2.0,   107.16
 3.0,   148.44
 4.0,   196.40
 5.0,   254.44
 6.0,   300.00


# Select a time not measured.
time = 8

# Use the model to compute a predicted distance for that time.
distance = model(time)

# Inspect the value of the predicted distance traveled.
print(distance)

#If your car can travel, at most, 400 miles on a full tank, and it takes 8 hours to drive home, will you make it without refilling? You should have answer=True if you'll make it, or answer=False if you will run out of gas.
# Determine if you will make it without refueling.
answer = (distance <= 400)
print(answer)
<script.py> output:
    400
    True
    
    
Notice that the car can travel just to the range limit of 400 miles, so you'd run out of gas just as you completed the trip
