Plotting the Data
Everything in python is an object, even modules. Your goal in this exercise is to review the use of the object oriented interfaces to the python library matplotlib in order to visualize measured data in a more flexible and extendable work flow. The general plotting work flow looks like this:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
fig, axis = plt.subplots()
axis.plot(x, y, color="green", linestyle="--", marker="s")
plt.show()




# Create figure and axis objects using subplots()
fig, axis = plt.subplots()

# Plot line using the axis.plot() method
#no line, "o" marker, red
line = axis.plot(times, distances , linestyle=" ", marker="o", color="red")

#alternative code
#line = axis.plot(times, distances , "ro")


# Use the plt.show() method to display the figure
plt.show()



times, distances
 0.0,     0.25
 1.0,     0.93
 2.0,     2.32
 3.0,     3.76
 4.0,     3.88
 5.0,     4.88
 6.0,     6.79
 7.0,     7.38
 8.0,     7.77
 9.0,     9.27
10.0,     9.77

Notice how linestyle=' ' means no line at all, just markers. Also note that your plot style is different than the context figure; I've hidden some more complex styling with title text and grid lines. More on that later! If you wish to experiment now, try different values for the style key-words to see the results. Set them to the requested values before submitting your answer
