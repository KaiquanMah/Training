Linear Proportionality
The definition of temperature scales is related to the linear expansion of certain liquids, such as mercury and alcohol. Originally, these scales were literally rulers for measuring length of fluid in the narrow marked or "graduated" tube as a proxy for temperature. The alcohol starts in a bulb, and then expands linearly into the tube, in response to increasing temperature of the bulb or whatever surrounds it.

In this exercise, we will explore the conversion between the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales as a demonstration of interpreting slope and intercept of a linear relationship within a physical context.

# Complete the function to convert C to F
def convert_scale(temps_C):
    (freeze_C, boil_C) = (0, 100)
    (freeze_F, boil_F) = (32, 212)
    change_in_C = boil_C - freeze_C
    change_in_F = boil_F - freeze_F
    slope = change_in_F / change_in_C
    intercept = freeze_F - freeze_C
    temps_F = intercept + (slope * temps_C)
    return temps_F

# Use the convert function to compute values of F and plot them
temps_C = np.linspace(0, 100, 101)
temps_F = convert_scale(temps_C)
fig = plot_temperatures(temps_C, temps_F)
Compare your plot with the one that was pre-loaded at the beginning of the exercise. Do they match?
