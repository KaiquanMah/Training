Time-series data provides a context in which the "slope" of the linear model represents a "rate-of-change".

In this exercise, you will use measurements of sea level change from 1970 to 2010, build a linear model of that changing sea level and use it to make a prediction about the future sea level rise.

Help on function plot_data_and_forecast in module __main__:

plot_data_and_forecast(years, levels, years_forecast, levels_forecast)
    Purpose:
        Over-plot the forecast data with the measured data used to fit the model
    Args:
        years (np.array): independent ("x") variable of measured data set
        levels (np.array): dependent ("y") variable of measured data set
        years_forecast (np.array): independent ("x") variable of forecast/modeled data
        levels_forecast (np.array): dependent ("y") variable of forecast/modeled data
    Returns:
        fig (matplotlib.figure): matplotlib figure object containing the plot





# Import LinearRegression class, build a model, fit to the data
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True)
model.fit(years, levels)

# Use model to make a prediction for one year, 2100
future_year = 2100
future_level = model.predict(future_year)
print("Prediction: year = {}, level = {:.02f}".format(future_year, future_level[0,0]))

# Use model to predict for many years, and over-plot with measured data
years_forecast = np.linspace(1970, 2100, 131).reshape(-1, 1)
levels_forecast = model.predict(years_forecast)
fig = plot_data_and_forecast(years, levels, years_forecast, levels_forecast)


<script.py> output:
    Prediction: year = 2100, level = 16.66
Note that with scikit-learn, although we could extract a0 = model.intercept_[0] and a1 = model.coef_[0,0], we do not need to do that in order to make predictions, we just call model.predict(). With more complex models, these parameters may not have easy physical interpretations. Notice also that although our model is linear, the actual data appears to have an up-turn that might be better modeled by adding a quadratic or even exponential term to our model. The linear model forecast may be underestimating the rate of increase in sea level.
