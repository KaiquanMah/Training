Sample Statistics versus Population
In this exercise you will work with a preloaded population. You will construct a sample by drawing points at random from the population. You will compute the mean standard deviation of the sample taken from that population to test whether the sample is representative of the population. Your goal is to see where the sample statistics are the same or very close to the population statistics.



# Compute the population statistics
print("Population mean {:.1f}, stdev {:.2f}".format( population.mean(), population.std() ))

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Construct a sample by randomly sampling 31 points from the population
sample = np.random.choice(population, size=31)

# Compare sample statistics to the population statistics
print("    Sample mean {:.1f}, stdev {:.2f}".format( sample.mean(), sample.std() ))


<script.py> output:
    Population mean 100.0, stdev 9.74
        Sample mean 102.1, stdev 9.34

Notice that the sample statistics are similar to the population statistics, but not the identical. If you were to compute the len() of each array, it is very different, but the means are not that much different as you might expect.
