Why Inheritance?
Why is it useful to declare a class that inherits from an abstract class?

You want to overwrite your existing base class.
You want to make a copy of the class somewhere else.

#YES - You want to extend the functionality of your current class without overwriting it.
That's right! Inheritance allows us to pass features down into a child class.
