Abstract Class DataShell II
Now that we have our abstract class DataShell, we can now create a second class that inherits from it.
Specifically, we will define a class called CsvDataShell. This class will have the ability to import a CSV file. In the following exercises we will add a bit more functionality to make our classes more sophisticated!


Import numpy as np and pandas as pd.
Create class DataShell with initialization method and input arguments self and inputFile. In the method body, define the instance variable file, and set it to the value of inputFile. All this is already done for you.
Create a second class, CsvDataShell, which inherits from DataShell. Add an initialization method, which takes as input arguments both self and inputFile. Declare an instance variable data and set it to the value of pd.read_csv(inputFile).
Instantiate CsvDataShell as us_data_shell, passing us_life_expectancy as input to the constructor, and print us_data_shell.data to explore its contents.


# Load numpy as np and pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Create class: DataShell
class DataShell:
    def __init__(self, inputFile):
        self.file = inputFile

# Create class CsvDataShell, which inherits from DataShell
class CsvDataShell(DataShell):
    # Initialization method with arguments self, inputFile
    def __init__(self, inputFile):
        # Instance variable data
        self.data = pd.read_csv(inputFile)


# Instantiate CsvDataShell as us_data_shell, passing us_life_expectancy as argument
us_data_shell = CsvDataShell(us_life_expectancy)

# Print us_data_shell.data
print(us_data_shell.data)


<script.py> output:
               country code  year  life_expectancy
    0    United States  USA  1880        39.410000
    1    United States  USA  1890        45.209999
    2    United States  USA  1901        49.299999

Awesome. We are now seeing inheritance in action in the context of our DataShell class. What other classes might you create, that inherit from DataShell? Maybe ones that import TSV files? Maybe JSON?
