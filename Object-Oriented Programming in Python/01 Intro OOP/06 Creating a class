Creating a class
We're going to be working on building a class, which is a way to organize functions and variables in Python. To start with, let's look at the simplest possible way to create a class.


Declare a class called DataShell.
Our class will not do much: simply include the pass statement in the body of the DataShell class.

# Create a class: DataShell
class DataShell: 
    pass
    
Good job! Try creating different classes with different names. See what kind of naming convention Python will accept.
