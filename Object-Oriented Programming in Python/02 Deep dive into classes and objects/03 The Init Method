The Init Method
Now it's time to explore the special __init__ method!
__init__ is an initialization method used to construct class instances in custom ways. In this exercise we will simply introduce the utilization of the method, and in subsequent ones we will do fancier things.


Create a class called DataShell.
Include the __init__() method, and pass it the self argument.
In the body of the __init__() method, include the pass statement.
Instantiate the DataShell class and assign the newly created object to the my_data_shell variable. Then print my_data_shell and explore its contents.

# Create class: DataShell
class DataShell:
  
	# Initialize class with self argument
    def __init__(self):
      
        # Pass statement
        pass

# Instantiate DataShell: my_data_shell
my_data_shell = DataShell()

# Print my_data_shell
print(my_data_shell)


<script.py> output:
    <__main__.DataShell object at 0x7f67bc2a2cf8>


Now you know about the initialization method (__init__())! Notice that this method takes in as input argument the self keyword. Could we input other arguments?
