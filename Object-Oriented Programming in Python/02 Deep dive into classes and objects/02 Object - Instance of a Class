Object: Instance of a Class
As we learned earlier, a class is like a blueprint: we can make many copies of our class.
When we do this, we say that we are instantiating our class. These instances are called objects.

Here is an example of class instantiation:
object_name = ClassName()



Create an empty class called DataShell. Only include the pass statement inside of the class definition.
Instantiate the DataShell class and assign the newly created object to the my_data_shell variable.
Print my_data_shell and explore its contents.



# Create empty class: DataShell
class DataShell:
  
    # Pass statement
    pass

# Instantiate DataShell: my_data_shell
my_data_shell = DataShell()

# Print my_data_shell
print(my_data_shell)

<script.py> output:
    <__main__.DataShell object at 0x7f67bc286470>

Good job! Now you have created an instance of the DataShell class. Try creating additional instances with different names!
