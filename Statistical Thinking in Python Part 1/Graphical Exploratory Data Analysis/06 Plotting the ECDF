# You will now use your ecdf() function to compute the ECDF for the petal lengths of Anderson's Iris versicolor flowers. You will then plot the ECDF. Recall that your ecdf() function returns two arrays so you will need to unpack them. An example of such unpacking is x, y = foo(data), for some function foo().





# Compute ECDF for versicolor data: x_vers, y_vers
#Use ecdf() to compute the ECDF of versicolor_petal_length. Unpack the output into x_vers and y_vers.
x_vers, y_vers = ecdf(versicolor_petal_length)

# Generate plot
#Plot the ECDF as dots. Remember to include marker = '.' and linestyle = 'none' in addition to x_vers and y_vers as arguments inside plt.plot().
_ = plt.plot(x_vers,y_vers,marker = '.',linestyle = 'none')

# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('Versicolor Petal Length')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')


# Display the plot
plt.show()
