# 1990 and 2015 featured the most no-hitters of any season of baseball (there were seven). Given that there are on average 251/115 no-hitters per season, what is the probability of having seven or more in a season?

# Draw 10,000 samples out of Poisson distribution: n_nohitters
#Draw 10000 samples from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 251/115 and assign to n_nohitters.
n_nohitters = np.random.poisson(251/115, size=10000)

# Compute number of samples that are seven or greater: n_large
n_large = np.sum(n_nohitters >= 7)

# Compute probability of getting seven or more: p_large
#Compute the probability, p_large, of having 7 or more no-hitters by dividing n_large by the total number of samples (10000).
p_large = n_large/10000

# Print the result
print('Probability of seven or more no-hitters:', p_large)

#The result is about 0.007. This means that it is not that improbable to see a 7-or-more no-hitter season in a century. We have seen two in a century and a half, so it is not unreasonable.
