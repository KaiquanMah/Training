# The mean of all measurements gives an indication of the typical magnitude of a measurement. It is computed using np.mean().


# Compute the mean: mean_length_vers
mean_length_vers=np.mean(versicolor_petal_length)

# Print the result with some nice formatting
print('I. versicolor:', mean_length_vers, 'cm')
