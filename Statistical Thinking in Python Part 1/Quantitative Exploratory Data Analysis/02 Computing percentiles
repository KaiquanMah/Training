# In this exercise, you will compute the percentiles of petal length of Iris versicolor.

# Specify array of percentiles: percentiles
#Create percentiles, a NumPy array of percentiles you want to compute. These are the 2.5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 97.5th. You can do so by creating a list containing these ints/floats and convert the list to a NumPy array using np.array(). For example, np.array([30, 50]) would create an array consisting of the 30th and 50th percentiles.
percentiles = np.array([2.5,25,50,75,97.5])

# Compute percentiles: ptiles_vers
#Use np.percentile() to compute the percentiles of the petal lengths from the Iris versicolor samples. The variable versicolor_petal_length is in your namespace.
ptiles_vers = np.percentile(versicolor_petal_length, percentiles)

# Print the result
print(ptiles_vers)
