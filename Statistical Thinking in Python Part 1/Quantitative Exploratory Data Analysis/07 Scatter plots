# When you made bee swarm plots, box plots, and ECDF plots in previous exercises, you compared the petal lengths of different species of iris. But what if you want to compare two properties of a single species? This is exactly what we will do in this exercise. We will make a scatter plot of the petal length and width measurements of Anderson's Iris versicolor flowers. If the flower scales (that is, it preserves its proportion as it grows), we would expect the length and width to be correlated.
# For your reference, the code used to produce the scatter plot in the video is provided below:

_ = plt.plot(total_votes/1000, dem_share, marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.xlabel('total votes (thousands)')
_ = plt.ylabel('percent of vote for Obama')


# Make a scatter plot
_ = plt.plot(versicolor_petal_length,versicolor_petal_width,marker='.', linestyle='none')


# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Versicolor Petal Length')
plt.ylabel('Versicolor Petal Width')

# Show the result
plt.show()
