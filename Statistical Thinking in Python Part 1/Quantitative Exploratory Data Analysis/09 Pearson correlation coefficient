# As mentioned in the video, the Pearson correlation coefficient, also called the Pearson r, is often easier to interpret than the covariance. It is computed using the np.corrcoef() function. Like np.cov(), it takes two arrays as arguments and returns a 2D array. Entries [0,0] and [1,1] are necessarily equal to 1 (can you think about why?), and the value we are after is entry [0,1].
# In this exercise, you will write a function, pearson_r(x, y) that takes in two arrays and returns the Pearson correlation coefficient. You will then use this function to compute it for the petal lengths and widths of I. versicolor.
# Again, we include the scatter plot you generated in a previous exercise to remind you how the petal width and length are related.



def pearson_r(x, y):
    """Compute Pearson correlation coefficient between two arrays."""
    # Compute correlation matrix: corr_mat
    corr_mat = np.corrcoef(x,y)

    # Return entry [0,1]
    return corr_mat[0,1]

# Compute Pearson correlation coefficient for I. versicolor: r
r = pearson_r(versicolor_petal_length,versicolor_petal_width)

# Print the result
print(r)
