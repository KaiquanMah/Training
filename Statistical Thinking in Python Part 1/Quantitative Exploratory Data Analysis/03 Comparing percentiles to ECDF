# To see how the percentiles relate to the ECDF, you will plot the percentiles of Iris versicolor petal lengths you calculated in the last exercise on the ECDF plot you generated in chapter 1. The percentile variables from the previous exercise are available in the workspace as ptiles_vers and percentiles.
# Note that to ensure the Y-axis of the ECDF plot remains between 0 and 1, you will need to rescale the percentiles array accordingly - in this case, dividing it by 100.



# Plot the ECDF
_ = plt.plot(x_vers, y_vers, '.')
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')

# percentiles = array([ 2.5, 25. , 50. , 75. , 97.5])
# Overlay percentiles as red diamonds, ie marker='D', color='red'
_ = plt.plot(ptiles_vers, percentiles/100, marker='D', color='red',
         linestyle='none')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
