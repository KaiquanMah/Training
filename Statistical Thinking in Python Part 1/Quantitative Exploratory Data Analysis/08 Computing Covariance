# The covariance may be computed using the Numpy function np.cov(). For example, we have two sets of data x and y, np.cov(x, y) returns a 2D array where entries [0,1] and [1,0] are the covariances. Entry [0,0] is the variance of the data in x, and entry [1,1] is the variance of the data in y. This 2D output array is called the covariance matrix, since it organizes the self- and covariance.
# To remind you how the I. versicolor petal length and width are related, we include the scatter plot you generated in a previous exercise.



# Compute the covariance matrix: covariance_matrix
covariance_matrix=np.cov(versicolor_petal_length,versicolor_petal_width)

# Print covariance matrix
print(covariance_matrix)

# Extract covariance of length and width of petals: petal_cov
#Extract the covariance from entry [0,1] of the covariance matrix. Note that by symmetry, entry [1,0] is the same as entry [0,1].
petal_cov = covariance_matrix[0,1]

# Print the length/width covariance
print(petal_cov)
