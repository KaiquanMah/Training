# As mentioned in the video, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. You will see this for yourself by computing the standard deviation using np.std() and comparing it to what you get by computing the variance with np.var() and then computing the square root.



# Compute the variance: variance
variance = np.var(versicolor_petal_length)

# Print the square root of the variance
print(np.sqrt(variance))

# Print the standard deviation
print(np.std(versicolor_petal_length))
