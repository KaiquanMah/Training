# Now, you'll use your sampling function to compute the waiting time to observe a no-hitter and hitting of the cycle. The mean waiting time for a no-hitter is 764 games, and the mean waiting time for hitting the cycle is 715 games.

# Draw samples of waiting times: waiting_times
#Use your successive_poisson() function to draw 100,000 out of the distribution of waiting times for observing a no-hitter and a hitting of the cycle.
waiting_times = successive_poisson(764,715,100000)

# Make the histogram
#Plot the PDF of the waiting times using the step histogram technique of a previous exercise. Don't forget the necessary keyword arguments. You should use bins=100, normed=True, and histtype='step'.
plt.hist(waiting_times,bins=100, normed=True, histtype='step')


# Label axes
plt.xlabel('Waiting Time')
plt.ylabel('Poisson')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
