Searching a book with shell
There is a copy of Charles Dickens's infamous 'Tale of Two Cities' in your home directory called two_cities.txt.
Use command line arguments such as cat, grep and wc with the right flag to count the number of lines in the book that contain either the character 'Sydney Carton' or 'Charles Darnay'. Use exactly these spellings and capitalizations.

repl:~$ cat two_cities.txt | egrep "Sydney Carton|Charles Darnay"  | wc -l
77

#yes - 77
32
45

Nice piping! My code looked like this, though there are many ways to accomplish this cat two_cities.txt | egrep 'Sydney Carton|Charles Darnay' | wc -l. Note that egrep is exactly the same as grep -E. Your skills in shell commands and pattern matching will be very useful in the next Bash scripts we create!
