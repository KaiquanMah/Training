Extract and edit using Bash scripts
Continuing your work for the Bulgarian soccer league - you need to do some editing on the data you have. Several teams have changed their names so you need to do some replacements. The data is the same as the previous exercise.
You will need to create a Bash script that makes use of sed to change the required team names.


Create a pipe using sed twice to change the team Cherno to Cherno City first, and then Arda to Arda United.
Pipe the output to a file called soccer_scores_edited.csv.
Save your script and run from the console. Try opening soccer_scores_edited.csv using shell commands to confirm it worked (the first line should be changed)!


#!/usr.bash

# Create a sed pipe to a new file

# > output to file
# >> append to file
cat soccer_scores.csv | sed 's/Cherno/Cherno City/g' | sed 's/Arda/Arda United/g' > soccer_scores_edited.csv

# Now save and run!






repl:~/workspace$ cat soccer_scores_edited.csv | head -n 3
ï»¿Year,Winner,Winner Goals
1932,Arda United,4
1933,Botev,1



Nice work! You were able to use sed to do some quick cleaning of your files. You can run this easily now without having to remember that long and messy pipe. Now you can build on these skills by working with arguments fed into your next scripts!
