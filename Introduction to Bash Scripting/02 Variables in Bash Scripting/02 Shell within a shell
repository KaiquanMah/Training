Shell within a shell
Which of the following correctly uses a 'shell within a shell' to will print out the date? We do not want to select the option that will just print out the string 'date'.


You could try these in the console yourself!
#no - echo "Right now it is "date""
Remember that double quotes treat what is inside literally (with a few exceptions), so this will just print the string 'date'.

#no - echo "Right now it is $date"
We have not created a variable for $date so this will print blank.

#yes - echo "Right now it is `date`"
Nice work! You used backticks to create a shell-within-a-shell, where the date program was called and returned as a string to print out. Being able to call out to a shell within a script opens up worlds of opportunity for your Bash scripting!





repl:~$ date

repl:~$ echo "Right now it is $date"
Right now it is


repl:~$ echo "$(date)"
