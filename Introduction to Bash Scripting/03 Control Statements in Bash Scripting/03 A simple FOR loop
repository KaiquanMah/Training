A simple FOR loop
You are working as a data scientist in an organization. Due to a recent merge of departments, you have inherited a folder with many files inside. You know that the .R scripts may be useful for your work but you aren't sure what they contain.
Write a simple Bash script to loop through all the files in the directory inherited_folder/ that end in .R and print out their names so you can get a quick look at what sort of scripts you have. Hopefully the file names are useful!


Use a FOR statement to loop through files that end in .R in inherited_folder/ using a glob expansion.
echo out each file name into the console.
# Use a FOR loop on files in directory
for file in inherited_folder/*.R
do  
    # Echo out each file
    echo $file
done

Great looping! Some of those files seem useful and others not so much! Whilst a simple example, it is important to master the basics before building onto more advanced topics. This simple script could be reused and run in any folder to print out the R files now. Let's build on this knowledge by practicing your understanding of WHILE loops!
