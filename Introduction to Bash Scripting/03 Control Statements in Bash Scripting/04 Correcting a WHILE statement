Correcting a WHILE statement
There is a script placed in this directory which has a mistake in it. It is some code to modify some employee files, but only for the first 1000 employees. Do not attempt to run the script as the necessary files are not in this directory.
Using your knowledge of WHILE scripts, can you determine where the mistake is? What will happen if it runs?
You can find the code by using cat emp_script.sh to print it to the console.


repl:~$ pwd
/home/repl
repl:~$ ls
emp_script.sh

repl:~$ cat emp_script.sh
#!/usr/bash

emp_num=1
while [ $emp_num -le 1000 ];
do
    cat "$emp_num-dailySales.txt"|egrep'Sales_total'|sed 's/.* ://' > "$emp_num-agg.txt"
done






There is no mistake, this script will run just fine.
You cannot cat a .txt file so this will fail.

#yes - It will run forever because emp_num isn't incremented inside the loop.
Great stuff! You correctly identified that this script will run forever because the emp_num variable is not incremented. A WHILE statement continues until some condition is no longer true. We only wanted to continue until emp_num of 1000 but we will never reach there if it is not incremented!
