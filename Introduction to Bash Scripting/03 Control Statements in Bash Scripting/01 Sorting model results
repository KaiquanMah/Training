Sorting model results
You are working as a data scientist in a large corporation. The production environment for your machine learning models writes out text files into the model_results/ folder whenever an experiment is completed. The files have the following structure (example):
Model Name: KNN
Accuracy: 89
F1: 0.87
Date: 2019-12-01
ModelID: 34598utjfddfgdg


You can see the model name, accuracy and F1 scores, the date the experiment completed and a unique ID to link the model experiment back into your experiment system.
The company has a threshold of 90% for accuracy for a model to continue experimentation. Your task is to write a Bash script that takes in an ARGV argument (a filename), extracts the accuracy score and conditionally sorts the model result file into one of two folders: good_models/ for those with accuracy greater than or equal to 90 and bad_models/ for those less than 90.

accuracy=$(grep Accuracy $1 | sed 's/.* //')

# Conditionally move into good_models folder
if [ $accuracy -ge 90 ]; then
    mv $1 good_models/
fi

# Conditionally move into bad_models folder
if [ $accuracy -lt 90 ]; then
    mv $1 bad_models/
fi
