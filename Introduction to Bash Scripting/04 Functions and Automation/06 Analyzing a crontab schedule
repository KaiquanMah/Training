Analyzing a crontab schedule
Using your knowledge of the structure of a crontab schedule, can you determine how often the script.sh Bash script will run if the following line is in the user's crontab?
15 * * * 6,7 bash script.sh

15 minutes past every hour for every day in June and July.
Run for 15 days then stop for 6 or 7 days, then resume.

#yes - 15 minutes past every hour on Saturdays and Sundays.
Correct! The first star being 15 means 'run every 15 minutes' and the last star is for the days of the week. Hence 6 and 7 means to run on every 6th and 7th days of the week or all Saturdays and Sundays.
