Driving test
Through the next exercises, we will learn how to build a data generating process (DGP) through progressively complex examples.

In this exercise, you will simulate a very simple DGP. Suppose that you are about to take a driving test tomorrow. Based on your own practice and based on data you have gathered, you know that the probability of you passing the test is 90% when it's sunny and only 30% when it's raining. Your local weather station forecasts that there's a 40% chance of rain tomorrow. Based on this information, you want to know what is the probability of you passing the driving test tomorrow.

This is a simple problem and can be solved analytically. Here, you will learn how to model a simple DGP and see how it can be used for simulation.



The seed for this exercise is set to 222

#Write a function test_outcome() to simulate the weather.
#Set weather as 'rain' or 'sun' depending on the input argument p_rain (the probability of rain).
#Based on the weather, return 'pass' or 'fail'.

sims, outcomes, p_rain, p_pass = 1000, [], 0.40, {'sun':0.9, 'rain':0.3}

def test_outcome(p_rain):
    # Simulate whether it will rain or not
    weather = np.random.choice(['rain', 'sun'], p=[p_rain, 1-p_rain])
    # Simulate and return whether you will pass or fail
    return np.random.choice(['pass', 'fail'], p=[p_pass[weather], 1-p_pass[weather]])

print("Probability of Passing the driving test = {}".format(pass_outcomes_frac))

    Probability of Passing the driving test = 0.654
