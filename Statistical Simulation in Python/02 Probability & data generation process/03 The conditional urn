The conditional urn
As we've learned, conditional probability is defined as the probability of an event given another event. To illustrate this concept, let's turn to an urn problem.

We have an urn that contains 7 white and 6 black balls. Four balls are drawn at random. We'd like to know the probability that the first and third balls are white, while the second and the fourth balls are black.

Upon completion, you will learn to manipulate simulations to calculate simple conditional probabilities.




#Initialize the counter success to 0 and sims to 5000.
#Define a list, urn, with 7 white balls ('w') and 6 black balls ('b').
# Initialize success, sims and urn
success, sims = 0, 5000
urn = ['w','w','w','w','w','w','w','b','b','b','b','b','b']

for _ in range(sims):
    # Draw 4 balls without replacement
    draw = np.random.choice(urn, replace=False, size=4)
    
    # Count the number of successes
    # Draw 4 balls without replacement and check to see if the first and third are white and second and fourth are black
    if draw[0]=='w' and draw[2]=='w' and draw[1]=='b'  and draw[3]=='b': 
        success +=1

print("Probability of success = {}".format(success/sims))


The seed for this exercise is set to 123
<script.py> output:
    Probability of success = 0.0722
