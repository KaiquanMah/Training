Throwing two fair dice
We now know how to implement the first two steps of a simulation. Now let's implement the next step - defining the relationship between random variables.

Often times, our simulation will involve not just one, but multiple random variables. Consider a game where throw you two dice and win if each die shows the same number. Here we have two random variables - the two dice - and a relationship between each of them - we win if they show the same number, lose if they don't. In reality, the relationship between random variables can be much more complex, especially when simulating things like weather patterns.

By the end of this exercise, you will be familiar with how to implement the third step of running a simulation - defining relationships between random variables.






# Initialize number of dice, simulate & record outcome
die, probabilities, num_dice = [1,2,3,4,5,6], [1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6], 2
outcomes = np.random.choice(die, size=num_dice, p=probabilities) 

# Win if the two dice show the same number
if outcomes[0] == outcomes[1]: 
    answer = 'win' 
else:
    answer = 'lose'

print("The dice show {} and {}. You {}!".format(outcomes[0], outcomes[1], answer))


The seed for this exercise is set to 223

<script.py> output:
    The dice show 5 and 5. You win!
    
    
    
Now you know how to define relationships between multiple random variables
