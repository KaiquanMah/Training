Portfolio Simulation - Part I
In the next few exercises, you will calculate the expected returns of a stock portfolio & characterize its uncertainty.

Suppose you have invested $10,000 in your portfolio comprising of multiple stocks. You want to evaluate the portfolio's performance over 10 years. You can tweak your overall expected rate of return and volatility (standard deviation of the rate of return). Assume the rate of return follows a normal distribution.

First, let's write a function that takes the principal (initial investment), number of years, expected rate of return and volatility as inputs and returns the portfolio's total value after 10 years.

Upon completion of this exercise, you will have a function you can call to determine portfolio performance.






In [9]: rates
Out[9]: array([-0.09284459,  0.21960182,  0.11244677, -0.15594421, -0.01679004])




#In the function definition, accept four arguments: number of years yrs, the expected rate of return avg_return, volatility as inputs sd_of_return, and principal (initial investment) principal.
#Simulate rates of return for each year as a normal random variable.

# rates is a Normal random variable and has size equal to number of years
def portfolio_return(yrs, avg_return, sd_of_return, principal):
    np.random.seed(123)
    rates = np.random.normal(loc=avg_return, scale=sd_of_return, size=yrs)
    
    
    #Initialize end_return to the principal input.
    end_return = principal
    
    # Calculate the return at the end of the period
    for x in rates:
        end_return *= (1+x)
    return end_return




#Use portfolio_return() to calculate and print result.
result = portfolio_return(yrs = 5, avg_return = 0.07, sd_of_return = 0.15, principal = 1000)
print("Portfolio return after 5 years = {}".format(result))




<script.py> output:
    Portfolio return after 5 years = 1021.4013412039292
    
    
    

Now let's use this function to understand the distribution of returns.
