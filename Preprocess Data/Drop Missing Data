# Convert missing values denoted by '?' to NaN
# NaN is an efficient and simplified way of internally representing missing data
# NaN will lay the foundation for using Pandas methods such as .dropna() and .fillna() to remove NaN valus
# NaN values can also be removed by Scikit-learn's Imputation transformer: Imputer()
df[df == '?'] = np.nan

# Print the number of NaNs
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Print shape of original DataFrame
print("Shape of Original DataFrame: {}".format(df.shape))

# Drop missing values and print shape of new DataFrame
df = df.dropna()

# Print shape of new DataFrame
print("Shape of DataFrame After Dropping All Rows with Missing Values: {}".format(df.shape))
