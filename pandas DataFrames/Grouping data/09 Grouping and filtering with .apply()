# By using .apply(), you can write functions that filter rows within groups. The .apply() method will handle the iteration over individual groups and then re-combine them back into a Series or DataFrame.
# In this exercise you'll take the Titanic data set and analyze survival rates from the 'C' deck, which contained the most passengers. To do this you'll group the dataset by 'sex' and then use the .apply() method on a provided user defined function which calculates the mean survival rates on the 'C' deck:

def c_deck_survival(gr):

    c_passengers = gr['cabin'].str.startswith('C').fillna(False)

    return gr.loc[c_passengers, 'survived'].mean()
# The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as titanic.



# Create a groupby object using titanic over the 'sex' column: by_sex
by_sex = titanic.groupby('sex')

# Call by_sex.apply with the function c_deck_survival
c_surv_by_sex = by_sex.apply(c_deck_survival)

# Print the survival rates
print(c_surv_by_sex)
