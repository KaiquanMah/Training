# If you have a DataFrame with a multi-level row index, the individual levels can be used to perform the groupby. This allows advanced aggregation techniques to be applied along one or more levels in the index and across one or more columns.
# In this exercise you'll use the full Gapminder dataset which contains yearly values of life expectancy, population, child mortality (per 1,000) and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) for every country in the world from 1964 to 2013.
# Your job is to create a multi-level DataFrame of the columns 'Year', 'Region' and 'Country'. Next you'll group the DataFrame by the 'Year' and 'Region' levels. Finally, you'll apply a dictionary aggregation to compute the total population, spread of per capita GDP values and average child mortality rate.
# The Gapminder CSV file is available as 'gapminder.csv'.



# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame and sort the index: gapminder
gapminder = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv', index_col=['Year','region','Country']).sort_index()

# Group gapminder by 'Year' and 'region': by_year_region
by_year_region = gapminder.groupby(level=['Year', 'region'])

# Define the function to compute spread: spread
def spread(series):
    return series.max() - series.min()

# Create the dictionary: aggregator
aggregator = {'population':'sum', 'child_mortality':'mean', 'gdp':spread}

# Aggregate by_year_region using the dictionary: aggregated
aggregated = by_year_region.aggregate(aggregator)

# Print the last 6 entries of aggregated 
print(aggregated.tail(6))
