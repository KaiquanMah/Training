# You are now going to continue working with the users DataFrame. As always, first explore it in the IPython Shell to see the layout and note the index.
# Your job in this exercise is to unstack and then stack the 'city' level, as you did previously for 'weekday'. Note that you won't get the same DataFrame.


# Unstack users by 'city': bycity
bycity = users.unstack(level='city')

# Print the bycity DataFrame
print(bycity)

# Stack bycity by 'city' and print it
print(bycity.stack(level='city'))
