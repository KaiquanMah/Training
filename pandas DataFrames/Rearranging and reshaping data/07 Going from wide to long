# You can move multiple columns into a single column (making the data long and skinny) by "melting" multiple columns. In this exercise, you will practice doing this.
# The users DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you. As always, explore it in the IPython Shell and note the index.



# Melt users: skinny
skinny = pd.melt(users, id_vars=['weekday','city'])

# Print skinny
print(skinny)
