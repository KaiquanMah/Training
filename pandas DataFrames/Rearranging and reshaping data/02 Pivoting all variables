# If you do not select any particular variables, all of them will be pivoted. In this case - with the users DataFrame - both 'visitors' and 'signups' will be pivoted, creating hierarchical column labels.
# You will explore this for yourself now in this exercise.


# Pivot users with signups indexed by weekday and city: signups_pivot
signups_pivot = users.pivot(index='weekday',columns='city',values='signups')

# Print signups_pivot
print(signups_pivot)

# Pivot users pivoted by both signups and visitors: pivot
pivot =  users.pivot(index='weekday',columns='city')

# Print the pivoted DataFrame
print(pivot)
