# Recall from the video that a pivot table allows you to see all of your variables as a function of two other variables. In this exercise, you will use the .pivot_table() method to see how the users DataFrame entries appear when presented as functions of the 'weekday' and 'city' columns. That is, with the rows indexed by 'weekday' and the columns indexed by 'city'.
# Before using the pivot table, print the users DataFrame in the IPython Shell and observe the layout.


# Create the DataFrame with the appropriate pivot table: by_city_day
by_city_day = users.pivot_table(index='weekday',columns='city')

# Print by_city_day
print(by_city_day)
