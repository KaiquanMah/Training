# You can also use aggregation functions within a pivot table by specifying the aggfunc parameter. In this exercise, you will practice using the 'count' and len aggregation functions - which produce the same result - on the users DataFrame.


# Use a pivot table to display the count of each column: count_by_weekday1
count_by_weekday1 = users.pivot_table(index='weekday',aggfunc='count')

# Print count_by_weekday
print(count_by_weekday1)

# Replace 'aggfunc='count'' with 'aggfunc=len': count_by_weekday2
count_by_weekday2 = users.pivot_table(index='weekday',aggfunc=len)

# Verify that the same result is obtained
print('==========================================')
print(count_by_weekday1.equals(count_by_weekday2))
