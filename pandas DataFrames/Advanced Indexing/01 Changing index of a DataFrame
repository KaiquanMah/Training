# As you saw in the previous exercise, indexes are immutable objects. This means that if you want to change or modify the index in a DataFrame, then you need to change the whole index. You will do this now, using a list comprehension to create the new index.

# A list comprehension is a succinct way to generate a list in one line. For example, the following list comprehension generates a list that contains the cubes of all numbers from 0 to 9: cubes = [i**3 for i in range(10)]. This is equivalent to the following code:

cubes = []
for i in range(10):
    cubes.append(i**3)
# Before getting started, print the sales DataFrame in the IPython Shell and verify that the index is given by month abbreviations containing lowercase characters.

# By the way, if you haven't downloaded it already, check out the Pandas Cheat Sheet. It includes an overview of the most important concepts, functions and methods and might come in handy if you ever need a quick refresher!


# Create the list of new indexes: new_idx
new_idx = [month.upper() for month in sales.index]

# Assign new_idx to sales.index
sales.index = new_idx

# Print the sales DataFrame
print(sales)
