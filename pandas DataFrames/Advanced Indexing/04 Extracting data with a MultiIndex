# In the video, Dhavide explained the concept of a hierarchical index, or a MultiIndex. You will now practice working with these types of indexes.
# The sales DataFrame you have been working with has been extended to now include State information as well. In the IPython Shell, print the new sales DataFrame to inspect the data. Take note of the MultiIndex!
# Extracting elements from the outermost level of a MultiIndex is just like in the case of a single-level Index. You can use the .loc[] accessor as Dhavide demonstrated in the video.


# Print sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']]
# Print sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']]. Note how New York is excluded.
print(sales.loc[['CA', 'TX']])

# Print sales['CA':'TX']
# Print sales['CA':'TX']. Note how New York is included.
print(sales['CA':'TX'])
