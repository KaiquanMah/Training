# Notice that in the previous exercise, the index was not labeled with a name. In this exercise, you will set its name to 'MONTHS'.
# Similarly, if all the columns are related in some way, you can provide a label for the set of columns.
# To get started, print the sales DataFrame in the IPython Shell and verify that the index has no name, only its data (the month names).


# Assign the string 'MONTHS' to sales.index.name
sales.index.name = 'MONTHS'

# Print the sales DataFrame
print(sales)

# Assign the string 'PRODUCTS' to sales.columns.name 
# Now assign the string 'PRODUCTS' to sales.columns.name to give a name to the set of columns.
sales.columns.name = 'PRODUCTS'

# Print the sales dataframe again
print(sales)
