# You may want to know which countries won medals in the most distinct sports. The .nunique() method is the principal aggregation here. Given a categorical Series S, S.nunique() returns the number of distinct categories.


# Group medals by 'NOC': country_grouped
country_grouped = medals.groupby('NOC')

# Compute the number of distinct sports in which each country won medals: Nsports
# Compute the number of distinct sports in which each country won medals. To do this, select the 'Sport' column from country_grouped and apply .nunique().
Nsports = country_grouped['Sport'].nunique()

# Sort the values of Nsports in descending order
# Sort Nsports in descending order with .sort_values() and ascending=False
Nsports = Nsports.sort_values(ascending=False)

# Print the top 15 rows of Nsports
print(Nsports.head(15))
