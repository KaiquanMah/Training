# You will now inspect the suspect record by locating the offending row.
# You will see that, according to the data, Joyce Chepchumba was a man that won a medal in a women's event. That is a data error as you can confirm with a web search.



# Create the Boolean Series: sus
sus = (medals.Event_gender == 'W') & (medals.Gender == 'Men')

# Create a DataFrame with the suspicious row: suspect
suspect = medals[sus]

# Print suspect
print(suspect)
