# What could be the difference between the 'Event_gender' and 'Gender' columns? You should be able to evaluate your guess by looking at the unique values of the pairs (Event_gender, Gender) in the data. In particular, you should not see something like (Event_gender='M', Gender='Women'). However, you will see that, strangely enough, there is an observation with (Event_gender='W', Gender='Men').
# The duplicates can be dropped using the .drop_duplicates() method, leaving behind the unique observations. The DataFrame has been loaded as medals.


# Select columns: ev_gen
ev_gen = medals[['Event_gender', 'Gender']]

# Drop duplicate pairs: ev_gen_uniques
ev_gen_uniques = ev_gen.drop_duplicates()

# Print ev_gen_uniques
print(ev_gen_uniques)
