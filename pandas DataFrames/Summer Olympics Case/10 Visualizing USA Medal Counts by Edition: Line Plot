# Your job in this exercise is to visualize the medal counts by 'Edition' for the USA. The DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as medals.



# Create the DataFrame: usa
usa = medals[medals.NOC == 'USA']

# Group usa by ['Edition', 'Medal'] and aggregate over 'Athlete'
usa_medals_by_year = usa.groupby(['Edition', 'Medal'])['Athlete'].count()

# Reshape usa_medals_by_year by unstacking
#Use .unstack() with level='Medal' to reshape the DataFrame usa_medals_by_year.
usa_medals_by_year = usa_medals_by_year.unstack('Medal')

# Plot the DataFrame usa_medals_by_year
#Construct a line plot from the final DataFrame usa_medals_by_year.
usa_medals_by_year.plot()
plt.show()
