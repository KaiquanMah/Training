# As in the previous exercise, your job in this exercise is to visualize the medal counts by 'Edition' for the USA. This time, you will use an area plot to see the breakdown better. The usa DataFrame has been created and all reshaping from the previous exercise has been done. You need to write the plotting command.




# Create the DataFrame: usa
usa = medals[medals.NOC == 'USA']

# Group usa by 'Edition', 'Medal', and 'Athlete'
usa_medals_by_year = usa.groupby(['Edition', 'Medal'])['Athlete'].count()

# Reshape usa_medals_by_year by unstacking
usa_medals_by_year = usa_medals_by_year.unstack(level='Medal')

# Create an area plot of usa_medals_by_year
usa_medals_by_year.plot.area()
plt.show()
