# You will now use .groupby() to continue your exploration. Your job is to group by 'Event_gender' and 'Gender' and count the rows.
# You will see that there is only one suspicious row: This is likely a data error.
# The DataFrame is available to you as medals.


# Group medals by the two columns: medals_by_gender
medals_by_gender = medals.groupby(['Event_gender', 'Gender'])

# Create a DataFrame with a group count: medal_count_by_gender
medal_count_by_gender = medals_by_gender.count()

# Print medal_count_by_gender
print(medal_count_by_gender)
