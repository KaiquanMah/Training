# Given a pair of label-based indices, sometimes it's necessary to find the corresponding positions. In this exercise, you will use the Pennsylvania election results again. The DataFrame is provided for you as election.
# Find x and y such that election.iloc[x, y] == election.loc['Bedford', 'winner']. That is, what is the row position of 'Bedford', and the column position of 'winner'? Remember that the first position in Python is 0, not 1!
# To answer this question, first explore the DataFrame using election.head() in the IPython Shell and inspect it with your eyes.
# This course introduces a lot of new concepts, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Pandas Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

# Explore the DataFrame in the IPython Shell using election.head().

# Assign the row position of election.loc['Bedford']: x
x = 4

# Assign the column position of election['winner']: y
y = 4

# Print the boolean equivalence
print(election.iloc[x, y] == election.loc['Bedford', 'winner'])
