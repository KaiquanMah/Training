# In this exercise, we have provided the Pennsylvania election results and included a column called 'turnout' that contains the percentage of voter turnout per county. Your job is to prepare a boolean array to select all of the rows and columns where voter turnout exceeded 70%.
# As before, the DataFrame is available to you as election with the index set to 'county'.


# Create the boolean array: high_turnout
high_turnout = election.turnout>70

# Filter the election DataFrame with the high_turnout array: high_turnout_df
high_turnout_df = election[high_turnout]

# Print the high_turnout_results DataFrame
print(high_turnout_df)
