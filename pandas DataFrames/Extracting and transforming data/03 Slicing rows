# The Pennsylvania US election results data set that you have been using so far is ordered by county name. This means that county names can be sliced alphabetically. In this exercise, you're going to perform slicing on the county names of the election DataFrame from the previous exercises, which has been pre-loaded for you.

# Slice the row labels 'Perry' to 'Potter': p_counties
p_counties = election.loc['Perry':'Potter']

# Print the p_counties DataFrame
print(p_counties)

# Slice the row labels 'Potter' to 'Perry' in reverse order: p_counties_rev
# Slice the row labels 'Potter' to 'Perry' in reverse order. To do this for hypothetical row labels 'a' and 'b', you could use a stepsize of -1 like so: df.loc['b':'a':-1].
p_counties_rev = election.loc['Potter':'Perry':-1]

# Print the p_counties_rev DataFrame
print(p_counties_rev)
