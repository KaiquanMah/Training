# Often, you don't just want to see the regression itself but also see the residuals to get a better idea how well the regression captured the data. Seaborn provides sns.residplot() for that purpose, visualizing how far datapoints diverge from the regression line.
# In this exercise, you will visualize the residuals of a regression between the 'hp' column (horse power) and the 'mpg' column (miles per gallon) of the auto DataFrame used previously.




# Import plotting modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Generate a green residual plot of the regression between 'hp' and 'mpg'
sns.residplot(x='hp', y='mpg', data=auto, color='green')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
