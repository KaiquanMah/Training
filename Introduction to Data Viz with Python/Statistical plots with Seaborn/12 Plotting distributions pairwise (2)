# In this exercise, you will generate pairwise joint distributions again. This time, you will make two particular additions:

# You will display regressions as well as scatter plots in the off-diagonal subplots. You will do this with the argument kind='reg' (where 'reg' means 'regression'). Another option for kind is 'scatter' (the default) that plots scatter plots in the off-diagonal subplots.
# You will also visualize the joint distributions separated by continent of origin. You will do this with the keyword argument hue specifying the 'origin'.



# Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
print(auto.head())

# Plot the pairwise joint distributions grouped by 'origin' along with regression lines
sns.pairplot(auto,kind='reg',hue='origin')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
