# Both strip and swarm plots visualize all the datapoints. For large datasets, this can result in significant overplotting. Therefore, it is often useful to use plot types which reduce a dataset to more descriptive statistics and provide a good summary of the data. Box and whisker plots are a classic way of summarizing univariate distributions but seaborn provides a more sophisticated extension of the standard box plot, called a violin plot.
# Here, you will produce violin plots of the distribution of horse power ('hp') by the number of cylinders ('cyl'). Additionally, you will combine two different plot types by overlaying a strip plot on the violin plot.
# As before, the DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as auto.


# Generate a violin plot of 'hp' grouped horizontally by 'cyl'
plt.subplot(2,1,1)
sns.violinplot(x='cyl', y='hp', data=auto)

# Generate the same violin plot again with a color of 'lightgray' and without inner annotations
plt.subplot(2,1,2)
sns.violinplot(x='cyl', y='hp', data=auto,color='lightgray',inner=None)

# Overlay a strip plot on the violin plot
# the strip plot will be in the same subplot as the bottom violin plot
sns.stripplot(x='cyl', y='hp', data=auto, jitter=True,size=1.5)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
