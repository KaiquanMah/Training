# Having plotted pre-computed moving averages of AAPL stock prices on distinct subplots in the previous exercise, you will now plot pre-computed moving standard deviations of the same stock prices, this time together on common axes.

# The time series aapl is not plotted in this case; it is of a different length scale than the standard deviations.
# The time series std_30, std_75, stdn_125, & std_250 have been computed for you (containing the windowed standard deviations of the series aapl computed over windows of width 30 days, 75 days, 125 days, & 250 days respectively).



# Plot std_30 in red
plt.plot(std_30, 'red', label='30d')

# Plot std_75 in cyan
plt.plot(std_75, 'cyan', label='75d')

# Plot std_125 in green
plt.plot(std_125, 'green', label='125d')


# Plot std_250 in magenta
plt.plot(std_250, 'magenta', label='250d')


# Add a legend to the upper left
plt.legend(loc='upper left')

# Add a title
plt.title('Moving standard deviations')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
