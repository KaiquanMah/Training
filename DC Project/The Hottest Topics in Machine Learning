Good to know
Welcome to the Project! While working on the different tasks in this Project, make sure to first read the narrative for each task in the notebook on the right, before reading the more detailed instructions here!
To complete this Project you need to know some Python, pandas, and Natural Language Processing. We recommend one is familiar with the content in DC's pandas Foundations, Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, and Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python courses.
For this exercise in particular, you can find more information about loading a CSV file with the pandas library here. You can also look at a similar exercise here on loading CSV files. If you print the first few rows of data, you should see a table with 7 columns.
