# The Tweet listener that creates a file called 'tweets.txt', collects streaming tweets as .jsons and writes them to the file 'tweets.txt'; once 100 tweets have been streamed, the listener closes the file and stops listening.
# Initialize Stream listener
l = MyStreamListener()

# Create your Stream object with authentication
stream = tweepy.Stream(auth, l)


# Filter Twitter Streams to capture data by the keywords:
stream.filter(track = ['clinton', 'trump', 'sanders', 'cruz'])
