# Import package
import requests

# Specify the url: url
url = 'http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation'

# Packages the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response: text
# Use the text attribute of the object r to return the HTML of the webpage as a string; store the result in a variable text.
text = r.text

# Print the html
print(text)

# Note that unlike urllib, you don't have to close the connection when using requests!
