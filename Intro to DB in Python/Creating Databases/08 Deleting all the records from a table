# Often, you'll need to empty a table of all of its records so you can reload the data. You can do this with a delete statement with just the table as an argument. For example, in the video, Jason deleted the table extra_employees by executing as follows:
# delete_stmt = delete(extra_employees)
# result_proxy = connection.execute(delete_stmt)
# Do be careful, though, as deleting cannot be undone!


# Import delete, select
from sqlalchemy import delete, select

# Build a statement to empty the census table: stmt
stmt = delete(census)

# Execute the statement: results
results = connection.execute(stmt)

# Print affected rowcount
print(results.rowcount)

# Build a statement to select all records from the census table
stmt = select([census])

# Print the results of executing the statement to verify there are no rows
print(connection.execute(stmt).fetchall())
