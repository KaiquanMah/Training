# It's time to practice inserting multiple records at once!
# You'll want to first build a list of dictionaries that represents the data you want to insert. Then, in the .execute() method, you can pair this list of dictionaries with an insert statement, which will insert all the records in your list of dictionaries.

# Build a list of dictionaries: values_list
values_list = [
    {'name': 'Anna', 'count': 1, 'amount': 1000.00, 'valid': True},
    {'name': 'Taylor', 'count': 1, 'amount': 750, 'valid': False}
]

# Build an insert statement for the data table: stmt
stmt = insert(data)

# Execute stmt with the values_list: results
results = connection.execute(stmt, values_list)

# Print rowcount
print(results.rowcount)
