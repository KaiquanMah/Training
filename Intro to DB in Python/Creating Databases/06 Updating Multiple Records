# As Jason discussed in the video, by using a where clause that selects more records, you can update multiple records at once. It's time now to practice this!
# For your convenience, the names of the tables and columns of interest in this exercise are: state_fact (Table), notes (Column), and census_region_name (Column).

# Build a statement to update the notes to 'The Wild West': stmt
stmt = update(state_fact).values(notes = 'The Wild West')

# Append a where clause to match the West census region records
stmt = stmt.where(state_fact.columns.census_region_name == 'West')

# Execute the statement: results
results = connection.execute(stmt)

# Print rowcount
print(results.rowcount)
