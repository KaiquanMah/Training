# You're now going to practice dropping individual tables from a database with the .drop() method, as well as all tables in a database with the .drop_all() method!
# As Spider-Man's Uncle Ben (as well as Jason, in the video!) said: With great power, comes great responsibility. Do be careful when deleting tables, as it's not simple or fast to restore large databases! Remember, you can check to see if a table exists with the .exists() method.


# Drop the state_fact table
state_fact.drop(engine)

# Check to see if state_fact exists
print(state_fact.exists(engine))

# Drop all tables
metadata.drop_all(engine)

# Check to see if census exists
print(census.exists(engine))
