# There are several ways to perform an insert with SQLAlchemy; however, we are going to focus on the one that follows the same pattern as the select statement.
# It uses an insert statement where you specify the table as an argument, and supply the data you wish to insert into the value via the .values() method as keyword arguments.
# Here, the name of the table is data.

# Import insert and select from sqlalchemy
from sqlalchemy import insert, select

# Build an insert statement to insert a record into the data table: stmt
stmt = insert(data).values(name='Anna', count=1, amount=1000.00, valid=True)

# Execute the statement via the connection: results
results = connection.execute(stmt)

# Print result rowcount
print(results.rowcount)

# Build a select statement to validate the insert
stmt = select([data]).where(data.columns.name == 'Anna')

# Print the result of executing the query.
print(connection.execute(stmt).first())
