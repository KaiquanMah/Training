# In this final exercise, you will write a query to calculate the states that changed the most in population. You will limit your query to display only the top 10 states.

# Build query to return state name and population difference from 2008 to 2000
stmt = select([census.columns.state,
     (census.columns.pop2008-census.columns.pop2000).label('pop_change')
])

# Group by State
stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

# Order by Population Change
stmt = stmt.order_by(desc('pop_change'))

# Limit to top 10
stmt = stmt.limit(10)

# Use connection to execute the statement and fetch all results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the state and population change for each record
for result in results:
    print('{}:{}'.format(result.state, result.pop_change))
