# In this exercise, you will use the func.sum() and group_by() methods to first determine the average age weighted by the population in 2008, and then group by sex.
# A weighted average is calculated as the sum of the product of the weights and averages divided by the sum of all the weights.
# For example, the following statement determines the average age weighted by the population in 2000:
# stmt = select([census.columns.sex,
#                (func.sum(census.columns.pop2000 * census.columns.age) /
#                 func.sum(census.columns.pop2000)).label('average_age')
#                ])


# Import select
from sqlalchemy import select

# Calculate weighted average age: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.sex,
               (func.sum(census.columns.pop2008 * census.columns.age) /
                func.sum(census.columns.pop2008)).label('average_age')
               ])

# Group by sex
stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.sex)

# Execute the query and store the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the average age by sex
for sex, average_age in results:
    print(sex, average_age)
