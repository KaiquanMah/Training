# Alright, it's time to create your first engine! An engine is just a common interface to a database, and the information it requires to connect to one is contained in a connection string, such as sqlite:///census_nyc.sqlite. Here, sqlite is the database driver, while census_nyc.sqlite is a SQLite file contained in the local directory.
# SQLAlchemy documentation - connection strings: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls
# Your job in this exercise is to create an engine that connects to a local SQLite file named census.sqlite. Then, print the names of the tables it contains using the .table_names() method. Note that when you just want to print the table names, you do not need to use engine.connect() after creating the engine.

# Import create_engine
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine that connects to the census.sqlite file: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Print table names
print(engine.table_names())
