# We can also take advantage of pandas and Matplotlib to build figures of our data. Remember that data visualization is essential for both exploratory data analysis and communication of your data!

# Import pyplot as plt from matplotlib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Create a DataFrame from the results: df
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Set Column names
df.columns = results[0].keys()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

# Plot the DataFrame
# df.plot.barh() shows bars extending in length horizontally to the right
# df.plot.bar() shows bars extending in length vertically
df.plot.bar()
plt.show()
