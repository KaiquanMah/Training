# Often, we want to get a count for each record with a particular value in another column. The .group_by() method helps answer this type of query. You can pass a column to the .group_by() method and use in an aggregate function like sum() or count(). Much like the .order_by() method, .group_by() can take multiple columns as arguments.

# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build a query to select the state and count of ages by state: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, func.count(census.columns.age)])

# Group stmt by state
stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)

# Print the keys/column names of the results returned
# Note that results[0].keys() can be == results[1].keys()
print(results[0].keys())
