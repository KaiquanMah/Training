# In these exercises, you will be working with real databases hosted on the cloud via Amazon Web Services (AWS)!
# Let's begin by connecting to a PostgreSQL database. When connecting to a PostgreSQL database, many prefer to use the psycopg2 database driver as it supports practically all of PostgreSQL's features efficiently and is the standard dialect for PostgreSQL in SQLAlchemy.
# You might recall from Chapter 1 that we use the create_engine() function and a connection string to connect to a database.
# There are three components to the connection string in this exercise: the dialect and driver ('postgresql+psycopg2://'), followed by the username and password ('username:pw'), followed by the host and port ()

# Import create_engine function
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to the census database
# ('postgresql+psycopg2://'+'student:datacamp'+'@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com'+':5432/census')
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://student:datacamp@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/census')

# Use the .table_names() method on the engine to print the table names
print(engine.table_names())
