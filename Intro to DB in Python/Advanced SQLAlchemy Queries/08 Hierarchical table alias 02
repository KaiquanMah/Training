# It's also common to want to roll up data which is in a hierarchical table. Rolling up data requires making sure you're careful which alias you use to perform the group_bys and which table you use for the function.
# Here, your job is to get a count of employees for each manager.

# Make an alias of the employees table: managers
managers = employees.alias()

# Build a query to select managers and counts of their employees: stmt
stmt = select([managers.columns.name, func.count(employees.columns.id)])

# Append a where clause that ensures the manager id and employee mgr are equal
stmt = stmt.where(managers.columns.id == employees.columns.mgr)

# Group by Managers Name
stmt = stmt.group_by(managers.columns.name,)

# Execute statement: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# print manager
for record in results:
    print(record)
