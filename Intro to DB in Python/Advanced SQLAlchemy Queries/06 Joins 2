# You can use the same select statement you built in the last exercise, however, let's add a twist and only return a few columns and use the other table in a group_by() clause.

# Build a statement to select the state, sum of 2008 population and census
# division name: stmt
stmt = select([
    census.columns.state,
    func.sum(census.columns.pop2008),
    state_fact.columns.census_division_name
])

# Append select_from to join the census and state_fact tables by the census state and state_fact name columns
stmt = stmt.select_from(
    census.join(state_fact, census.columns.state == state_fact.columns.name)
)

# Append a group by for the state_fact name column
stmt = stmt.group_by(state_fact.columns.name)

# Execute the statement and get the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Loop over the the results object and print each record.
for record in results:
    print(record)
