#part 1
#What is a network?
#Let's think again about examples of networks. Which of the following data is least easily modeled as a network?
#1 Airplane transportation. - Airplane transportation data would lend itself very well to being modeled as a network.
#2 Phone numbers in a telephone directory.
#3 Co-authorship of papers.
#4 Atoms in a molecule. - The atoms in a molecule have a natural relationship between each other that can be modeled as a network.

#2 Phone numbers in a telephone directory.
# Compared to the other options, it would not be as easy to model phone numbers in a telephone directory as a network.


#PART 2
#Checking the un/directed status of a graph
#In the video, Eric described to you different types of graphs. Which type of graph do you think the Twitter network data you have been working with corresponds to? Use Python's built-in type() function in the IPython Shell to find out. The network, as before, has been pre-loaded as T.
#Of the four below choices below, which one corresponds to the type of graph that T is?
#Undirected Graph.
#Directed Graph.
#Undirected Multi-Edge Graph.
#Directed Multi-Edge Graph.
