#Deep dive - Twitter network
#You're going to now take a deep dive into a Twitter network, which will help reinforce what you've learned earlier. First, you're going to find the nodes that can broadcast messages very efficiently to lots of people one degree of separation away.
#NetworkX has been pre-imported for you as nx.

#Write a function find_nodes_with_highest_deg_cent(G) that returns the node(s) with the highest degree centrality using the following steps:
# Define find_nodes_with_highest_deg_cent()
def find_nodes_with_highest_deg_cent(G):

    # Compute the degree centrality of G: deg_cent
    deg_cent = nx.degree_centrality(G)

    #Compute the maximum degree centrality using the max() function on list(deg_cent.values()).
    # Compute the maximum degree centrality: max_dc
    max_dc = max(list(deg_cent.values()))

    nodes = set()

    # Iterate over the degree centrality dictionary deg_cent.items().
    for k, v in deg_cent.items():
        
        #If the degree centrality value v of the current node k is equal to max_dc, add it to the set of nodes.
        # Check if the current value has the maximum degree centrality
        if v == max_dc:
            
            # I only need the node value
            # Add the current node to the set of nodes
            nodes.add(k)

    return nodes

# Find the node(s) that has the highest degree centrality in T: top_dc
top_dc = find_nodes_with_highest_deg_cent(T)
print(top_dc)

output:
    {11824}


#Write an assertion statement that checks that the node(s) is/are correctly identified.
# Write the assertion statement
for node in top_dc:
    assert nx.degree_centrality(T)[node] == max(nx.degree_centrality(T).values())
    

#Great work! It looks like node 11824 has the highest degree centrality.



#part 2
#Deep dive - Twitter network part II
#Next, you're going to do an analogous deep dive on betweenness centrality! Just a few hints to help you along: remember that betweenness centrality is computed using nx.betweenness_centrality(G).

#Write a function find_node_with_highest_bet_cent(G) that returns the node(s) with the highest betweenness centrality.
# Define find_node_with_highest_bet_cent()
def find_node_with_highest_bet_cent(G):
    
    #recall betweenness centrality looks at the shortest paths
    #Compute the betweenness centrality of G.
    # Compute betweenness centrality: bet_cent
    bet_cent = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)

    # Compute maximum betweenness centrality: max_bc
    max_bc = max(list(bet_cent.values()))

    nodes = set()
    
    #Iterate over the degree centrality dictionary, bet_cent.items().
    # Iterate over the betweenness centrality dictionary
    for k, v in bet_cent.items():

        # Check if the current value has the maximum betweenness centrality
        if v == max_bc:

            #i only want the node number k
            # Add the current node to the set of nodes
            nodes.add(k)

    return nodes

#Use your function to find the node(s) that has the highest betweenness centrality in T.
# Use that function to find the node(s) that has the highest betweenness centrality in the network: top_bc
top_bc = find_node_with_highest_bet_cent(T)

Output: {1}



# Write an assertion statement that checks that the node(s) is/are correctly identified.
for node in top_bc:
    assert nx.betweenness_centrality(T)[node] == max(nx.betweenness_centrality(T).values())
    

Fantastic, you have correctly identified that node 1 has the highest betweenness centrality!
