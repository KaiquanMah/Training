#Creating a data drift monitor
Azure Machine Learning supports data drift monitoring through the use of DATASETS. 
You can capture new feature data in a dataset and compare it to the dataset with which the model was trained.



#Monitor data drift by comparing datasets
#It's common for organizations to continue to collect new data after a model has been trained. 
#For example, a health clinic might use diagnostic measurements from previous patients to train a model that predicts diabetes likelihood, but continue to collect the same diagnostic measurements from all new patients. The clinic's data scientists could then periodically compare the growing collection of new data to the original training data, and identify any changing data trends that might affect model accuracy.

#To monitor data drift using registered datasets, you need to REGISTER TWO DATASETS:
1 A baseline dataset - usually the original training data.
2 A target dataset that will be compared to the baseline based on time intervals. This dataset requires a column for each feature you want to compare, and a timestamp column so the rate of data drift can be measured.

#You can configure a deployed service to collect new data submitted to the model for inferencing, 
#AND THE NEW DATASET IS SAVED IN AZURE BLOB STORAGE and 
#can be used as a target dataset for data drift monitoring.

#After creating these datasets, you can DEFINE A DATASET MONITOR to detect data drift and 
#TRIGGER ALERTS if the rate of drift exceeds a specified threshold. 
#You can create dataset monitors using the visual interface in Azure Machine Learning studio, or by 
#using the DataDriftDetector class in the Azure Machine Learning SDK as shown in the following example code:
#Python
from azureml.datadrift import DataDriftDetector

monitor = DataDriftDetector.create_from_datasets(workspace=ws,
                                                 name='dataset-drift-detector',
                                                 baseline_data_set=train_ds,
                                                 target_data_set=new_data_ds,
                                                 compute_target='aml-cluster',
                                                 frequency='Week',
                                                 #SO EVERY WEEK, TELL ME WHETHER THERE IS ANY DATA DRIFT IN THESE 3 FEATURES
                                                 feature_list=['age','height', 'bmi'],
                                                 #LATENCY = COLLECT NEW DATA OVER HOW MANY HOURS. 24 HOURS HERE
                                                 latency=24)


#After creating the dataset monitor, you can backfill to immediately compare the baseline dataset to existing data in the target dataset, as shown in the following example, which backfills the monitor based on weekly changes in data for the previous six weeks:
#QN: WHY ARE YOU BACKFILLING?
#Python
import datetime as dt

backfill = monitor.backfill( dt.datetime.now() - dt.timedelta(weeks=6), dt.datetime.now())





























#Scheduling alerts
#When you define a data monitor, you specify a SCHEDULE on which it should run. 
#Additionally, you can specify a THRESHOLD for the rate of data drift and 
#an OPERATOR EMAIL ADDRESS FOR NOTIFICATIONS if this threshold is exceeded.


#Configure data drift monitor schedules
#Data drift monitoring works by running a comparison at scheduled frequency, and calculating data drift metrics for the features in the dataset that you want to monitor. You can define a schedule to run every 
Day, 
Week, or 
Month.

#For dataset monitors, you can specify a latency, indicating 
#the number of hours to allow for new data to be collected and added to the target dataset. 

#For deployed model data drift monitors, you can specify a schedule_start time value to indicate 
#when the data drift run should start (if omitted, the run will start at the current time).






#Configure alerts
#Data drift is measured using a calculated magnitude of change in the statistical distribution of feature values over time. You can expect some natural random variation between the baseline and target datasets, but you should monitor for large changes that might indicate significant data drift.
#You can define a threshold for data drift magnitude above which you want to be notified, and configure alert notifications by email. The following code shows an example of scheduling a data drift monitor to run every week, and send an alert if the drift magnitude is greater than 0.3:
#Python
alert_email = AlertConfiguration('data_scientists@contoso.com')
monitor = DataDriftDetector.create_from_datasets(ws, 'dataset-drift-detector', 
                                                 baseline_data_set, target_data_set,
                                                 compute_target=cpu_cluster,
                                                 frequency='Week', 
                                                 latency=2,
                                                 drift_threshold=.3,
                                                 alert_configuration=alert_email)
