4 kinds of compute resources
Compute instances: Development WORKSTATIONS that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
Compute clusters: Scalable CLUSTERS of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
Inference clusters: Deployment targets for PREDICTIVE SERVICES that use your trained models.
Attached compute: LINKS TO OTHER AZURE COMPUTE RESOURCES, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.

#Installing the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python
bash
pip install azureml-sdk
#the notebooks extra include widgets for displaying DETAILED OUTPUT in Jupyter Notebooks, 
#the AutoML extra includes packages for AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING, and 
#the explain extra includes packages for GENERATING MODEL EXPLANATIONS

#Connecting to a Workspace
#azure portal>machine learning>overview
#config.json
{
    "subscription_id": "1234567-abcde-890-fgh...",
    "resource_group": "aml-resources",
    "workspace_name": "aml-workspace"
}


#connect to the workspace using the configuration file
#method 1
#By default, the from_config method looks for a file named config.json in the folder containing the Python code file, but you can specify another path if necessary.
#python
from azureml.core import Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()

#method 2
#use the get method of the Workspace class with explicitly specified subscription, resource group, and workspace details
#which you can obtain from config.json
#this method is preferred due to greater flexibility when using multiple scripts
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.get(name='aml-workspace',
                   subscription_id='1234567-abcde-890-fgh...',
                   resource_group='aml-resources')



#Working with the Workspace Class
#use the compute_targets attribute to retrieve a dictionary object containing the compute targets defined in the workspace
for compute_name in ws.compute_targets:
    compute = ws.compute_targets[compute_name]
    print(compute.name, ":", compute.type)


















#The Azure Machine Learning CLI Extension
#The Azure command-line interface (CLI) is a cross-platform command-line tool for managing Azure resources. 
#The Azure Machine Learning CLI extension is an additional package that provides commands for working with Azure Machine Learning.
#To install the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension, you must first install the Azure CLI.
#After installing the Azure CLI, you can add the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension by running the following command:
#Bash
az extension add -n azure-cli-ml

#To use the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension, run the az ml command with the appropriate parameters for the action you want to perform. 
#For example, to list the compute targets in a workspace, run the following command:
#-g parameter specifies the name of the resource group
#-w parameter specifies the name of the AZ ML workspace
az ml computetarget list -g 'aml-resources' -w 'aml-workspace'

#Compute Instances
#provide a development environment within a workspace
Jupyter Notebook
JupyterLab installations
RStudio
SSH

#You can store notebooks independently in workspace storage, and open them in any compute instance.












#Visual Studio Code
#code editing environment for 
Microsoft Windows, 
Apple macOS, and 
Linux

#languages supported
Microsoft C#, 
JavaScript, 
Python and others

#syntax formatting for common data formats such as 
JSON and 
XML
HTML

#install modular extensions that add 
syntax checking, 
debugging, and 
visual management interfaces
