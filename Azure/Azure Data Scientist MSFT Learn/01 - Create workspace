4 kinds of compute resources
Compute instances: Development WORKSTATIONS that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
Compute clusters: Scalable CLUSTERS of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
Inference clusters: Deployment targets for PREDICTIVE SERVICES that use your trained models.
Attached compute: LINKS TO OTHER AZURE COMPUTE RESOURCES, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.

#connect to the workspace using the configuration file
#method 1
#By default, the from_config method looks for a file named config.json in the folder containing the Python code file, but you can specify another path if necessary.
#python
from azureml.core import Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()

#method 2
#use the get method of the Workspace class with explicitly specified subscription, resource group, and workspace details
#which you can obtain from config.json
#this method is preferred due to greater flexibility when using multiple scripts
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.get(name='aml-workspace',
                   subscription_id='1234567-abcde-890-fgh...',
                   resource_group='aml-resources')
