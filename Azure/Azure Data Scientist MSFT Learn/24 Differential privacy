#protect individual data values by adding statistical "noise" to the analysis process
#ensures that data aggregations stay statistically consistent with the actual data values 
#while allowing for some random variation
#to make it impossible to work out the individual values from the aggregated data

#the noise is different for each analysis, 
#so the results are non-deterministic â€“ in other words, two analyses that perform the same aggregation may produce slightly different results.





#Configure data privacy parameters
#EPSILON PARAMETER
#PRIVACY VS ACCURACY
#A LOW EPSILON value provides 
#the MOST PRIVACY, at the expense of 
#less accuracy when aggregating the data. 

#A higher epsilon value results in aggregations that are 
#more true to the actual data distribution, but in which the individual contribution of a single individual to the aggregated value is 
#less obscured by noise.
