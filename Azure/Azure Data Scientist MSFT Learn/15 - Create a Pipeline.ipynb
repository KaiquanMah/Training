    "You can perform the various steps required to ingest data, train a model, and register the model individually by using the Azure ML SDK to run script-based experiments. However, in an enterprise environment it is common to encapsulate the sequence of discrete steps required to build a machine learning solution into a *pipeline* that can be run on one or more compute targets, either on-demand by a user, from an automated build process, or on a schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll bring together all of these elements to create a simple pipeline that pre-processes data and then trains and registers a model.\n",

In this case, the first step must write the prepared data to a folder that can be read from by the second step. Since the steps will be run on remote compute (and in fact, could each be run on different compute), the folder path must be passed as a data reference to a location in a datastore within the workspace. The **PipelineData** object is a special kind of data reference that is used for interim storage locations that can be passed between pipeline steps, so you'll create one and use at as the output for the first step and the input for the second step. Note that you also need to pass it as a script argument so our code can access the datastore location referenced by the data reference."

    "This is a simple example, designed to demonstrate the principle. In reality, you could build more sophisticated logic into the pipeline steps - for example, evaluating the model against some test data to calculate a performance metric like AUC or accuracy, comparing the metric to that of any previously registered versions of the model, and only registering the new model if it performs better.\n",

    "You can use the [Azure Machine Learning extension for Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml) to combine Azure ML pipelines with Azure DevOps pipelines (yes, it *is* confusing that they have the same name!) and integrate model retraining into a *continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)* process. For example you could use an Azure DevOps *build* pipeline to trigger an Azure ML pipeline that trains and registers a model, and when the model is registered it could trigger an Azure Devops *release* pipeline that deploys the model as a web service, along with the application or service that consumes the model."
