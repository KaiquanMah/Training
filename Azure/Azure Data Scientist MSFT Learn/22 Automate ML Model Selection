#Restricting algorithm selection
#By default, automated machine learning will randomly select from the full range of algorithms for the specified task. 
#You can choose to block individual algorithms from being selected; which can be 
#useful if you know that your DATA IS NOT SUITED to a particular type of algorithm, or 
#you have to comply with a POLICY THAT RESTRICTS the ML ALGORITHMS you can use in your organization.













#Data preprocessing and featurization
#apply preprocessing transformations to your data; improving the performance of the model.

#1 Scaling and normalization
#Automated machine learning applies scaling and normalization to numeric data automatically, helping 
#prevent any large-scale features from dominating training. 
#During an automated machine learning experiment, multiple scaling or normalization techniques will be applied.



#2 Optional featurization
You can choose to have automated machine learning apply preprocessing transformations such as:
-MISSING VALUE IMPUTATION to eliminate nulls in the training dataset.
-CATEGORICAL ENCODING to convert categorical features to numeric indicators.
-Dropping high-cardinality features, such as record IDs.
-FEATURE ENGINEERING (for example, DERIVING individual date parts from DateTime features)
-Others...


















#Running automated machine learning experiments
#To run an automated machine learning experiment, you can either 
#use the user interface in Azure Machine Learning studio, or 
#submit an experiment using the SDK.

#1 Configuring an automated machine learning experiment
#The user interface provides an intuitive way to select options for your automated machine learning experiment. 
#When using the SDK, you have greater flexibility, and you can set experiment options using the AutoMLConfig class, as shown in the following example:
#Python
from azureml.train.automl import AutoMLConfig

automl_run_config = RunConfiguration(framework='python')
automl_config = AutoMLConfig(name='Automated ML Experiment',
                             #type of algo/problem u want to solve
                             task='classification',
                             primary_metric = 'AUC_weighted',
                             compute_target=aml_compute,
                             training_data = train_dataset,
                             validation_data = test_dataset,
                             label_column_name='Label',
                             featurization='auto',
                             iterations=12,
                             max_concurrent_iterations=4)







#2 Specifying data for training
#Automated machine learning is designed to enable you to simply bring your data, and 
#have Azure Machine Learning figure out how best to train a model from it.

#UI
#When using the Automated Machine Learning user interface in Azure Machine Learning studio, you can 
#create or select an Azure Machine Learning dataset to be used as the input for your automated machine learning experiment.

#AZ ML SDK
#When using the SDK to run an automated machine learning experiment, you can submit the data in the following ways:
-Specify a dataset or dataframe of TRAINING DATA that includes FEATURES and the LABEL to be predicted.
-Optionally, specify a SECOND VALIDATION DATASET or dataframe that will be used to validate the trained model. if this is not provided, Azure Machine Learning will apply cross-validation using the training data.

#Alternatively:
-Specify a DATASET, DATAFRAME, OR NUMPY ARRAY of X values containing the training features, with a corresponding y ARRAY of label values.
-Optionally, specify X_valid and y_valid DATASETS, DATAFRAMES, OR NUMPY ARRAYS of X_valid values to be used for validation.

#3 Specifying the primary metric
#One of the most important settings you must specify is the primary_metric. 
#This is the target performance metric for which the optimal model will be determined. 
#Azure Machine #Learning supports a set of named metrics for each type of task. 
#To retrieve the list of metrics available for a particular task type, you can use the get_primary_metrics function as shown here:
#Python
from azureml.train.automl.utilities import get_primary_metrics

get_primary_metrics('classification')

#EXTRA - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-understand-automated-ml






#4 Submitting an automated machine learning experiment
#You can submit an automated machine learning experiment like any other SDK-based experiment:
#Python
from azureml.core.experiment import Experiment

automl_experiment = Experiment(ws, 'automl_experiment')
automl_run = automl_experiment.submit(automl_config)

#You can monitor automated machine learning experiment runs in Azure Machine Learning studio, or 
#in the Jupyter Notebooks RunDetails widget.






#5 Retrieving the best run and its model
#You can easily identify the best run in Azure Machine Learning studio, and 
#download or deploy the model AZ ML generated. 
#To accomplish this programmatically with the SDK, you can use code like the following example:
#Python
best_run, fitted_model = automl_run.get_output()
best_run_metrics = best_run.get_metrics()
for metric_name in best_run_metrics:
    metric = best_run_metrics[metric_name]
    print(metric_name, metric)






#6 Exploring preprocessing steps
#Automated machine learning uses scikit-learn pipelines to encapsulate preprocessing steps with the model. 
#You can view the steps in the fitted model you obtained from the best run using the code below like this:
#Python
for step_ in fitted_model.named_steps:
    print(step)
