    "# Tune Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many machine learning algorithms that require *hyperparameters* (parameter values that influence training, but can't be determined from the training data itself). For example, when training a logistic regression model, you can use a *regularization rate* hyperparameter to counteract bias in the model; or when training a convolutional neural network, you can use hyperparameters like *learning rate* and *batch size* to control how weights are adjusted and how many data items are processed in a mini-batch respectively. The choice of hyperparameter values can significantly affect the performance of a trained model, or the time taken to train it; and often you need to try multiple combinations to find the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you'll train a classification model with two hyperparameters, but the principles apply to any kind of model you can train with Azure Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure Machine Learning SDK is updated frequently. Run the following cell to upgrade to the latest release, along with the additional package to support notebook widgets."
