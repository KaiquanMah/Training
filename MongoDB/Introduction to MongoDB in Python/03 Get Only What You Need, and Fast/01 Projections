Shares of the 1903 Prize in Physics
You want to examine the laureates of the 1903 prize in physics and how they split the prize. Here is a query without projection:
db.laureates.find_one({"prizes": {"$elemMatch": {"category": "physics", "year": "1903"}}})

Which projection(s) will fetch ONLY the laureates' full names and prize share info? I encourage you to experiment with the console and re-familiarize yourself with the structure of laureate collection documents.

#NOT ["firstname", "surname", "prizes"]
#NOT ["firstname", "surname", "prizes.share"]
#This is a great way to project out just prize share info. However, we can also remove the '_id' field from the projection.


#YES {"firstname": 1, "surname": 1, "prizes.share": 1, "_id": 0}
#This represents the minimal projection to get the info we need. Great!
