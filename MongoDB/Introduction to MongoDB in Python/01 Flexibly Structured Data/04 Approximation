"born" approximation
The "born" field in a laureate collection document records the date of birth of that laureate. "born" values are of the form "YYYY-MM-DD", also known as ISO 8601 format. An example value is "1937-02-01", for February 1st, 1937. This format is convenient for lexicographic comparison. For example, the query

db.laureates.count_documents({"born": {"$lt": "1900"}})
returns the number of laureates with recorded dates of birth earlier than the year 1900 ("$lt" is for "less than"). Using the query format above, what is the number of laureates born prior to 1800? What about prior to 1700?


In [12]: db.laureates.count_documents({"born":{'$lt':'1800'}})
Out[12]: 38

In [11]: db.laureates.count_documents({"born":{'$lt':'1700'}})
Out[11]: 38

#38 prior to 1800, and 38 prior to 1700


#The first Nobel Prize was awarded in 1901, they are not awarded posthumously, so...some laureates lived to be more than 200 years old?? It turns out that a laureate's date of birth is recorded as '0000-00-00' when it is not known. Check your assumptions when working with data!
