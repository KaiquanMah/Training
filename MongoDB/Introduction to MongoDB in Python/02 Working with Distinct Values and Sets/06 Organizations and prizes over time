# Save a filter for organization laureates with prizes won before 1945

    }




n_before = db.laureates.count_documents(before)
n_in_or_after = db.laureates.count_documents(in_or_after)
ratio = n_in_or_after / (n_in_or_after + n_before)
print(ratio)
    0.84


Even though fewer than two thirds of Nobel prizes were awarded in 1945 and later, over 80% of organizations won prizes then.
