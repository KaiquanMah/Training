Triple plays (mostly) all around
Prizes can be shared, even by more than two laureates. In fact, all prize categories but one – literature – have had prizes shared by three or more laureates.


# Save a filter for prize documents with three or more laureates
criteria = {"laureates.2": {"$exists": True}}

# Save the set of distinct prize categories in documents satisfying the criteria
triple_play_categories = set(db.prizes.distinct("category", criteria))

# Confirm literature as the only category not satisfying the criteria.
assert set(db.prizes.distinct("category")) - triple_play_categories == {"literature"}
