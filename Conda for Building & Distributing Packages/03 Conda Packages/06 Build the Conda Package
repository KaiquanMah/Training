Build the Conda Package
Now that you've got the dependent packages defined in your Conda recipe you're ready to build the package.
The complete mortgage_forecasts Conda package has been loaded into your home directory. Included in the meta.yaml file is the recommended install command for Python-only Conda packages:
build:
    script: python setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record=record.txt





If the script: tag is not present in the meta.yaml file then conda build will expect the installation commands to be in a file called build.sh on Mac and Linux, or in build.bat on Windows.
Run conda build <package-name> with the name of your package.
