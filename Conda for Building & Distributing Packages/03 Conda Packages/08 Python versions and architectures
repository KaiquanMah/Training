Python versions and architectures
So far you've been developing and building your mortgage_forecasts package on a 64-bit Linux virtual machine with Python 3. The package you built in the last exercise can only be installed on 64-bit Linux machines along with Python 3.6.
The general practice is to run conda build separately on Windows, Mac, and Linux and with the popular minor revisions of Python (2.7, 3.5, 3.6, etc.). This step is necessary if you have architecture-specific build steps, like compiling Python C/C++ extensions, or incompatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 in both the build and run steps.
Since your mortgage_forecasts project is cross-architecture and it works on Python 2 and Python 3 you'll convert it to a noarch Conda package.
This means that only one package archive is required and can be installed with any version of Python on any architecture supported by Conda.

Edit meta.yaml to add the following line to the build: tag and before the script: tag.
    noarch: python
    number: 1
By default the build number is 0, so by setting it to 1 we indicate that the Conda package is different from build 0, but the source has not changed. The mortage_forecasts source is still version 0.1.
