Install the conda package
The mortgage_forecasts package you built in the last exercise is stored locally at the following path.
/home/repl/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/mortgage_forecasts-0.1-py36_0.tar.bz2

To install the package you'll use the --use-local flag to include the conda-bld directory when conda install searches for required packages.
To test that your package is working correctly, you'll make a new Conda environment.




Create a new Conda environment called models with only the python=3 package.
$ pwd/home/repl
$ ls
miniconda

$ conda create --name models python=3
