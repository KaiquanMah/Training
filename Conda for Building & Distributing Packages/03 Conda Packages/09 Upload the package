Upload the package
In the last exercise you created an architecture independent package archive for the mortgage_forecasts project. The final step is to upload the package to Anaconda Cloud so that others can install it from your channel.
You should have already created an account on Anaconda Cloud. You will be asked to enter your login credentials during this exercise.
Your working directory has been set to the conda-bld directory where conda build places package archives.


Run anaconda upload with the following file path as input
noarch/mortgage_forecasts-0.1-py_1.tar.bz2
and enter your login and password when prompted.

$ cd /home/repl/miniconda/conda-bld
$ ls
linux-64  noarch
$ ls noarch
mortgage_forecasts-0.1-py_1.tar.bz2  repodata.json  repodata.json.bz2
$ pwd
/home/repl/miniconda/conda-bld



$ anaconda upload noarch/mortgage_forecasts-0.1-py_1.tar.bz2
