Conda package dependencies
In the meta.yaml file dependent packages and versions are defined using comparison operators, such as <, <=, >, >=. Multiple version conditions are separated by commas. The glob * means that the preceding characters must match exactly.

Here's an example for a new package called my_package.
requirements:
    run:
        - python
        - scipy
        - numpy 1.11*
        - matplotlib >=1.5, <2.0


Which of the following statements below is INCORRECT?
#incorrect - NumPy version 1.13 is compatible with my_package.
Yes! Any version of NumPy after 1.11.x or before 1.12.0 can be installed.



#correct - Any version of Scipy can be installed with my_package.
SciPy is defined without a version comparison.

#correct - Conda will downgrade matplotlib if version 2 is installed.
Notice that only Matploblib versions older than version 2 are compatible.

#correct - my_package is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.
Notice that a Python version is not specified.
