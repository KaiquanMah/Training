Dependent package versions
The mortgage_forecasts package you wrote in the last chapter has been provided in your home directory.
In this exercise you'll specify the dependent packages along with their compatible versions.

This project is valid for both Python 2 and Python 3 and depends on the following packages
Python: any version greater than 2.7
Pandas: at least version 0.20
Scipy: any version compatible with Pandas 0.20
Statsmodels: any version compatible with the above restrictions



Edit the meta.yaml file to add a nested run: key under requirements: on line 13 like this
requirements:
    run:
        - python >=2.7
        - pandas >=0.20
        - statsmodels
        - scipy

$ pwd
/home/repl/mortgage_forecasts
$ ls
LICENSE  meta.yaml  mortgage_forecasts  setup.py  version.py

$ nano meta.yaml








#failed when i added '-' in front of the run requirements bullet points
$ cat meta.yaml
{% set setup_py = load_setup_py_data() %}

package:
    name: 'mortgage_forecasts'
    version: {{ setup_py.get('version') }}

source:
    path: ./

build:
    script: <command to install>

requirements:
    run:
        - python >= 2.7
        - pandas >= 0.20
        - statsmodels
        - scipy
        # Packages that must be installed
        # in the user's conda environment
        # to run this package.

    build:
        # Packages used by setup.py
        # to install this package.
        # May also install compilers
        # for non-python code.

    license: {{ setup_py.get('license') }}
    license_file: LICENSE
    summary: {{ setup_py.get('description') }}












#retry without '-' in front of the run requirements bullet points

The next step is to add the build requirements. The packages listed under build: are only those required to run python setup.py. In our case only python and setuptools are required.
At line 20 you'll see the build requirements section. Add python and setuptools to the requirements like you did for the run section.


$ nano meta.yaml

$ cat meta.yaml
{% set setup_py = load_setup_py_data() %}

package:
    name: 'mortgage_forecasts'
    version: {{ setup_py.get('version') }}

source:
    path: ./

build:
    script: <command to install>

requirements:
    run:
        python >=2.7
        pandas >=0.20
        statsmodels
        scipy
        # Packages that must be installed
        # in the user's conda environment
        # to run this package.

    build:
        python
        setuptools
        # Packages used by setup.py
        # to install this package.
        # May also install compilers
        # for non-python code.
