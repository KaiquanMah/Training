Licensing
Since our goal is to share our code with others we need to be aware of copyright laws and the legal rights we wish to retain about how that software can be used. Copyright protections are guaranteed to the person who owns the software. When someone else downloads and uses the program we built we would not want to transfer ownership to them, thereby forfeiting our rights.
Instead, we wish license usage of the program under certain restrictions. There are many kinds of software licenses and choosing a license is beyond the scope of this course.
For the mortgage_forecasts package we want to share our code with as few restrictions as necessary. The only important restriction is that we would like to be acknowledged as the original author. For this we'll choose the MIT license, which is widely used in open-source software packages.
The full text of the license has been placed in the mortgage_forecasts/LICENSE file and it must remain in the package directory for the license to be valid and enforceable.
Further, license="MIT" has been added in setup.py.
