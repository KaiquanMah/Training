Importing a package
A Python package can have any number of directories and module source files.

The directory mortgage_forecasts has been prepared for you in your home directory. It contains a subdirectory of the same name and two Python source code files.
mortgage_forecasts/
  mortgage_forecasts/
    models.py
    utils.py

models.py defines a new class to fit and predict 30-year mortgage rates in the US.
utils.py defines functions to read data and compute statistical quantities.

Your working directory has been set to /home/repl/mortgage_forecasts. Without changing directories, which import statement will provide access to the MortgageRateModel class defined in models.py?
You can use the terminal to test import statements. A conda environment has been activated with the dependent packages.

$ conda activate forecast
(forecast) $ ls
mortgage_forecasts
(forecast) $ pwd
/home/repl/mortgage_forecasts


import mortgage_forecasts
import models.MortgageRateModel
from mortgage_forecasts import MortgageRateModel
#yes from mortgage_forecasts.models import MortgageRateModel
