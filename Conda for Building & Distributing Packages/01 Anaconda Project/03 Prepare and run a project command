Prepare and run a project command
An Anaconda Project is provided for you at the directory /home/repl/babynames. There you will see the anaconda-project.yml file, which is the project specification file, and a Python script file main.py. When collaborating with other data scientists you may receive Anaconda Projects as compressed directories containing an anaconda-project.yml file along with source files.
In these exercises you'll explore this project and run the command-line-interface (CLI) defined in main.py.
The dataset used here is the number of male and female babes born by name in the US from 2000 to 2016 provided by The Social Security Administration.

The first step is to determine what packages are required for this project. For this you'll inspect the output of anaconda-project list-packages. This will show you what Conda packages are required to run this project.
$ cd babynames
$ ls
anaconda-project.yml  main.py

$ anaconda-project list-packages
Packages for environment 'default':
pandas
python=3





Now that you know that this project requires Python version 3 and the latest version of Pandas, you can prepare a new Conda environment within the project.
Run anaconda-project prepare to create the environment. It will create an envs/default directory in your project.
$ anaconda-project prepare

The project is ready to run commands.
Use `anaconda-project list-commands` to see what's available.








This project contains a main.py Python script file. To determine if the project itself has a defined command we'll look at the output of anaconda-project list-commands.
$ anaconda-project list-commands
Commands for project: /home/repl/babynames

Name          Description
====          ===========
search-names  python main.py























Running a command with Anaconda Project will automatically activate the conda environment that was created in envs/default.
The command search-names, defined in main.py, has the following help output.

usage: search-names [-h] name
Print occurrences of a name yearly since 2000.
positional arguments:
  name        Name to be searched for
optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit



Run this command with
anaconda-project run search-names <NAME>

where <NAME> is any name you'd like to search over. For example, Albert, or Jessi.

$ anaconda-project run search-names Alb
