Initialise a new project
Now it's your turn to create an Anaconda Project. In the following exercises you'll create a new directory to store your project, initialize the anaconda-project.yml specification file, add packages, and prepare the environment.
This project will download historic 30-year mortgage rates from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, fit an autoregressive model using data form January 2000 to January 2018, and forecast the mortgage rates monthly through December 2018.

Create a new directory called mortgage_rates.
$ pwd/home/repl
$ ls
miniconda
$ mkdir mortgage_rates
$ ls
miniconda  mortgage_rates



Navigate to the mortgage_rates directory.
$ cd mortgage_rates



Initialize the Anaconda Project specification using the following command:
anaconda-project init
$ anaconda-project init
Project configuration is in /home/repl/mortgage_rates/anaconda-project.yml
$ ls
anaconda-project.yml




Many of the actions you'll perform on your Anaconda Projects do not require manual editing of the anaconda-project.yml, but doing so can be very useful.
One action that does not have a CLI tool is adding a description of your project.
Edit the anaconda-project.yml file to add a description of the project. The description: tag is on line 19 of the file.
Edit the file so that line 19 looks like this

description: Forecast 30-year mortgage rates in the US

Available editors are nano, vi, vim, and emacs.
