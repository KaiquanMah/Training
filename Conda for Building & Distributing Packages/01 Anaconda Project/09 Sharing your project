Sharing your project
The core component of all Anaconda Projects is the anaconda-project.yml file. To share the project with other users you need to provide the anaconda-project.yml file and all other assets that cannot be automatically generated.
For the mortgage_rates project you have been building, the three necessary files to recreate and run the project are anaconda-project.yml, anaconda-project-lock.yml, and forecast.py. The directory envs and the file jpbAsR should not be included in the archive.
In this exercise, you'll create a compressed project archive and share it on Anaconda Cloud.
Note: You will need to create a free account on Anaconda Cloud to complete this exercise.

Archive your mortgage_rates project with the command
anaconda-project archive <zip-file>

where <zip-file> is the path to the zip file (in this case, /home/repl/mortgage_rates.zip). Note that you can specify either the relative or absolute path.
The zip file will only include anaconda-project.yml and forecast.py since those two files can be used to recreate the package and data downloads.
It is best practice not to create the zip archive within the project directory.
Notice that envs and jpbAsR are not included in the archive.

$ cd mortgage_rates
$ ls
anaconda-project-lock.yml  anaconda-project.yml  envs  forecast.py jpbAsR
$ anaconda-project archive /home/repl/mortgage_rates.zip
  added mortgage_rates/.projectignore
  added mortgage_rates/anaconda-project-lock.yml
  added mortgage_rates/anaconda-project.yml
  added mortgage_rates/forecast.py
Created project archive /home/repl/mortgage_rates.zip














The next step is to login with your Anaconda Cloud account using anaconda login.
anaconda login








Now you're ready to upload the archive. Be certain to include --package-type= or -t to declare that this archive is an Anaconda Project.
anaconda upload <zip-file> --package-type=project
Where <zip-file> is the path to the archive you made in the last step.
anaconda upload /home/repl/mortgage_rates.zip --package-type=project
anaconda upload /home/repl/mortgage_rates.zip -t
