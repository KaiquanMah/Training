Gathering unique Pokémon
A sample of 500 Pokémon has been created with replacement (meaning a Pokémon could be selected more than once and duplicates exist within the sample).

Three lists have been loaded into your session:

The names list contains the names of each Pokémon in the sample.
The primary_types list containing the corresponding primary type of each Pokémon in the sample.
The generations list contains the corresponding generation of each Pokémon in the sample.
The below function was written to gather unique values from each list:

def find_unique_items(data):
    uniques = []

    for item in data:
        if item not in uniques:
            uniques.append(item)

    return uniques
Let's compare the above function to using the set data type for collecting unique items.






Use the provided function to collect the unique Pokémon in the names list. Save this as uniq_names_func.
# Use the provided function to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_func = set(names)
print(len(uniq_names_func))

<script.py> output:
    368







Use a set data type to collect the unique Pokémon in the names list. Save this as uniq_names_set.
# Use find_unique_items() to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_func = find_unique_items(names)
print(len(uniq_names_func))

# Convert the names list to a set to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_set = set(uniq_names_func)
print(len(uniq_names_set))

# Check that both unique collections are equivalent
print(sorted(uniq_names_func) == sorted(uniq_names_set))

<script.py> output:
    368
    368
    True











Within your IPython console, use %timeit to compare the find_unique_items() function with using a set data type to collect unique Pokémon character names in names.
%timeit set(names)
%timeit find_unique_items(names)

10.1 us +- 402 ns per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
1.86 ms +- 75.6 us per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)



Which membership testing was faster?

Using the provided function that uses a loop to gather unique items is faster.
Both approaches have the same runtime.

#YES - Using a set to collect unique values is faster.









Use the most efficient approach for gathering unique items to collect the unique Pokémon types (from the primary_types list) and Pokémon generations (from the generations list).
# Use the best approach to collect unique primary types and generations
uniq_types = set(primary_types) 
uniq_gens = set(generations) 
print(uniq_types, uniq_gens, sep='\n') 


    {'Fighting', 'Rock', 'Ice', 'Fire', 'Ground', 'Electric', 'Poison', 'Dragon', 'Grass', 'Ghost', 'Water', 'Fairy', 'Bug', 'Dark', 'Psychic', 'Normal', 'Steel'}
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    
    Nice work! Using a set data type to collect unique values is much faster than using a for loop (like in the find_unique_items() function). Since a set is defined as a collection of distinct elements, it is an efficient way to collect unique items from an existing object. Here you took advantage of a set to find the distinct Pokémon from the sample (eliminating duplicate Pokémon) and saw what unique Pokémon types and generations were included in the sample.
