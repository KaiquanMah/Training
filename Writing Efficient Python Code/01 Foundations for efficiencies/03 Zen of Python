Zen of Python
In the video, we covered the Zen of Python written by Tim Peters, which lists 19 idioms that serve as guiding principles for any Pythonista. Python has hundreds of Python Enhancement Proposals, commonly referred to as PEPs. The Zen of Python is one of these PEPs and is documented as PEP20.
One little Easter Egg in Python is the ability to print the Zen of Python using the command import this. Let's take a look at one of the idioms listed in these guiding principles.
Type and run the command import this within your IPython console and answer the following question:

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!






What is the 7th idiom of the Zen of Python?
Flat is better than nested.
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Python is the best programming language ever.

#YES - Readability counts.
That's correct! Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes readability. Throughout the course, you'll see that writing efficient Python code goes hand in hand with writing code that is easy to understand. Faster code is good, but faster & readable code is best!
