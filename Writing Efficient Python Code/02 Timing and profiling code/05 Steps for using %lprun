Pop quiz: steps for using %lprun
Below is the convert_units() function, which converts the heights and weights of our favorite superheroes from metric units to Imperial units.

def convert_units(heroes, heights, weights):

    new_hts = [ht * 0.39370  for ht in heights]
    new_wts = [wt * 2.20462  for wt in weights]

    hero_data = {}

    for i,hero in enumerate(heroes):
        hero_data[hero] = (new_hts[i], new_wts[i])

    return hero_data
Suppose you have a list of superheroes (named heroes) along with each hero's height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) loaded as NumPy arrays (named hts and wts respectively).



What are the necessary steps you need to take in order to profile the convert_units() function acting on your superheroes data if you'd like to see line-by-line runtimes?

1 Use %load_ext line_profiler to load the line_profiler within your IPython session.
2 Use %lprun -f convert_units convert_units(heroes, hts, wts) to get line-by-line runtimes.
3 Use %timeit convert_units(heroes, hts, wts) to gather runtimes.

#YES - The first and second options from above are necessary.
Great job! Now that you've reviewed the necessary steps for profiling a function for runtime, it's time for you to practice profiling on your own!
