Using %timeit with number of runs and loops
A list of 480 superheroes has been loaded into your session (called heroes). You'd like to analyze the runtime for converting this heroes list into a set. Instead of relying on the default settings for %timeit, you'd like to only use 5 runs and 25 loops per each run.
What is the correct syntax when using %timeit and only using 5 runs with 25 loops per each run?

timeit -runs5 -loops25 set(heroes)
%%timeit -r5 -n25 set(heroes)
%timeit set(heroes), 5, 25

#YES - %timeit -r5 -n25 set(heroes)
Correct! %timeit lets you specify the number of runs and number of loops you want to consider with the -r and -n flags. You can use -r5 and -n25 to specify 5 iterations each with 25 loops when calculating the average and standard deviation of runtime for your code.
