1. Install Docker




2. Run PubSub+ Broker
Pull the message broker image from the Docker repository and start a container instance using these two steps:
-Start Docker and open a command-line terminal.
-Enter the following docker run command:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 55555:55555 -p:8008:8008 -p:1883:1883 -p:8000:8000 -p:5672:5672 -p:9000:9000 -p:2222:2222 --shm-size=2g --env username_admin_globalaccesslevel=adminUserName --env username_admin_password=adminPW --name=solace solace/solace-pubsub-standard

This command starts a message broker container named solace, using the latest PubSub+ Standard image pulled from Docker Hub, creates an admin user with global access permissions, and publishes the following message broker container ports to the same ports on your host machine:
port 8080 — Use this port when CONFIGURING the MESSAGE BROKER CONTAINER with Solace PubSub+ Broker Manager.
port 55555 — Your applications can use Solace APIs to CONNECT TO THE MESSAGE BROKER on this port.

port 8008 — The JavaScript sample applications below use this port to PASS WEB MESSAGING TRAFFIC THROUGH the message broker.
ports 1883 & 8000 — Ports for MQTT connectivity, over TCP and over WebSockets respectively
port 5672 — AMQP 1.0 applications using Apache QPID APIs would connect here
port 9000 — Use REST to send messaging and event data with Solace’s RESTful API port
port 2222 — Use SSH to connect to the Solace Command Line Interface (CLI) for advanced configuration






3. Run Samples
Now that you’ve started your message broker, you can publish and subscribe to a message using the sample Publisher and Subscriber applications below (this works best in a Chrome browser):
Click Connect to connect the Publisher application to your message broker.
Click Connect to connect the Subscriber application to your message broker.
In the Subscriber application, click Subscribe to subscribe to the topic/try/me topic.
In the Publisher application, click Publish to publish a “Hello World” message to the topic/try/me topic. The message you published is displayed under Messages in the Subscriber application.
