Prepare a model for distributed training
You've decided to use the Hugging Face Accelerator library to train your language translation model. Now it's time to prepare your model for distributed training!

Some data has been pre-loaded:
accelerator is an instance of Accelerator
model, optimizer, train_dataloader, and lr_scheduler have been defined




Call a method to prepare objects for distributed training.
Pass in the training objects to the method, matching the order of the output.


# Prepare objects for distributed training
model, optimizer, train_dataloader, lr_scheduler = accelerator.prepare(
    # Pass in the training objects matching the order of the output
    model,
    optimizer,
    train_dataloader,
    lr_scheduler)
