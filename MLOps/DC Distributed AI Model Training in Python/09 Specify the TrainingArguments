Specify the TrainingArguments
You're configuring the training process for your language model. TrainingArguments specifies input parameters for Trainer. This exercise provides values for these parameters; generally, you'll have to tune the parameters for a model. Prepare the arguments for your model to use Trainer!

Some data has been pre-loaded:
output_dir is a pre-defined directory
The TrainingArguments class has been imported



Define training_args using a transformers class.
Set the learning rate to 2e-5 to fine-tune pre-trained weights of your model.
Set train batch size on each device to 16 for this exercise.
Save and evaluate checkpoints every epoch
