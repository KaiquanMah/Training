Define evaluation metrics
You're developing a real-time language translation service in a video conferencing application. To monitor training, you'll define evaluation metrics for accuracy and F1 score, which measure overall model performance.
The evaluate and numpy (np) libraries have been pre-imported.


Load accuracy and f1 score using the evaluate library.
Extract logits and labels from the input eval_predictions.
Convert logits to predictions.
Compute accuracy and f1 score based on the predictions and labels.



def compute_metrics(eval_predictions):
    # Load accuracy and F1 score
    load_accuracy = evaluate.load("accuracy")
    load_f1 = evaluate.load("f1")

    # Extract logits and labels from eval_predictions
    logits, labels = eval_predictions
    # Convert logits to predictions
    predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    # Compute accuracy and F1 score
    accuracy = load_accuracy.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)["accuracy"]
    f1 = load_f1.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)["f1"]
    return {"accuracy": accuracy, "f1": f1}
