Automatic device placement with Accelerator
Your conversational AI model needs to train on a massive dataset, so you've decided to move the model to a GPU. You're leveraging Accelerator for automatic device placement. Note this exercise actually runs on the CPU, but the code remains the same for running on the GPU.
A BERT-based model has been preloaded as model.



Declare an accelerator object.
Use the accelerator object to prepare the model for distributed training with GPU.


from accelerate import Accelerator

# Declare an accelerator object
accelerator = Accelerator()

# Prepare the model for distributed training
model = accelerator.prepare(model)

print(accelerator.device)

<script.py> output:
    cpu
