Preprocess image datasets
You're developing a precision agriculture system to help farmers monitor crop health, using a pre-trained transformer model, which you can later fine-tune on agricultural imagery. Preprocess the dataset using AutoImageProcessor to prepare for training!

Some data has been pre-loaded:
The AutoImageProcessor class has been imported from transformers
model is equal to microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224
A sample dataset has been defined, with a sample image




Load a pre-trained image processor from the pre-defined model.
Apply the image_processor to the entire dataset.
Preprocess an image.


# Load a pre-trained image processor
print(f"model name: {model}")
image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(model)

# Apply the image_processor to the entire dataset
dataset = dataset.map(
    lambda examples: {
        "pixel_values": [
            # Preprocess an image
            image_processor(image, return_tensors="pt").pixel_values
            for image in examples["img"]
        ]
    },
    batched=True,
)
print(dataset[0]["img"])



<script.py> output:
    model name: microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224
    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=720x480 at 0x7F636B7D7FD0>
