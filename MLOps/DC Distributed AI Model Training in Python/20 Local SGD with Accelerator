Local SGD with Accelerator
You've implemented gradient accumulation and gradient checkpointing to streamline memory usage for your language translation model. Training is still a bit slow, so you decide to add local SGD to your training loop to improve communication efficiency between devices. Build the training loop with local SGD!
The model, train_dataloader, and accelerator have been pre-defined, and LocalSGD has been imported.


Set up a context manager for local SGD, and synchronize gradients every eight steps.
Step the local SGD context manager.

# Set up a context manager to synchronize gradients every eight steps
with LocalSGD(accelerator=accelerator, 
              model=model, 
              local_sgd_steps=8, 
              enabled=True) as local_sgd:
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        with accelerator.accumulate(model):
            inputs, targets = batch["input_ids"], batch["labels"]
            outputs = model(inputs, labels=targets)
            loss = outputs.loss
            accelerator.backward(loss)
            optimizer.step()
            lr_scheduler.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            # Step the local SGD context manager
            local_sgd.step()
