Save and load the state of preprocessed text
You've finished preprocessing a dataset of agricultural questions and answers to help farmers look up common issues in the field. To save your progress, you decide to create and load checkpoints of the preprocessed text data.

Some data has been preloaded:
dataloader contains a preprocessed dataset of agricultural questions and answers
Accelerator has been imported from accelerate




Prepare dataloader for distributed training using the accelerator.
Save a checkpoint of the preprocessed data in checkpoint_dir.
Load a checkpoint from checkpoint_dir


accelerator = Accelerator()

# Prepare the dataloader for distributed training
dataloader = accelerator.prepare(dataloader)

checkpoint_dir = Path("preprocess_checkpoint")

# Save a checkpoint of the data
accelerator.save_state(checkpoint_dir)

# Load from the checkpoint
accelerator.load_state(checkpoint_dir)
