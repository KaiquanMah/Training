Changing coefficients
With this understanding of the coefficients of a LogisticRegression() model, have a closer look at them to see how they change depending on what columns are used for training. Will the column coefficients change from model to model?
You should .fit() two different LogisticRegression() models on different groups of columns to check. You should also consider what the potential impact on the probability of default might be.
The data set cr_loan_clean has already been loaded into the workspace along with the training sets X1_train, X2_train, and y_train.

Check the first five rows of both X training sets.
Train a logistic regression model, called clf_logistic1, with the X1 training set.
Train a logistic regression model, called clf_logistic2, with the X2 training set.
Print the coefficients for both logistic regression models.

# Print the first five rows of each training set
print(X1_train.head())
print(X2_train.head())

Interesting! Notice that the coefficient for the person_income changed when we changed the data from X1 to X2. This is a reason to keep most of the data like we did in chapter 1, because the models will learn differently depending on what data they're given!
