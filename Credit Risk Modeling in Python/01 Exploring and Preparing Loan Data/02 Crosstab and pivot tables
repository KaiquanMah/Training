Crosstab and pivot tables
Often, financial data is viewed as a pivot table in spreadsheets like Excel.
With cross tables, you get a high level view of selected columns and even aggregation like a count or average. For most credit risk models, especially for probability of default, columns like person_emp_length and person_home_ownership are common to begin investigating.
You will be able to see how the values are populated throughout the data, and visualize them. For now, you need to check how loan_status is affected by factors like home ownership status, loan grade, and loan percentage of income.
The data set cr_loan has been loaded in the workspace.

Create a cross table of loan_intent and loan_status.
# Create a cross table of the loan intent and loan status
print(pd.crosstab(cr_loan['loan_intent'], cr_loan['loan_status'], margins = True))

Create a boxplot of the loan's percent of the person's income grouped by loan_status.
# Create a box plot of percentage income by loan status
cr_loan.boxplot(column = ['loan_percent_income'], by = 'loan_status')
plt.title('Average Percent Income by Loan Status')
plt.suptitle('')
plt.show()


It looks like the average percentage of income for defaults is higher. This could indicate those recipients have a debt-to-income ratio that's already too high.
