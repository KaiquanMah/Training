Explore the credit data
Begin by looking at the data set cr_loan. In this data set, loan_status shows whether the loan is currently in default with 1 being default and 0 being non-default.
You have more columns within the data, and many could have a relationship with the values in loan_status. You need to explore the data and these relationships more with further analysis to understand the impact of the data on credit loan defaults.
Checking the structure of the data as well as seeing a snapshot helps us better understand what's inside the set. Similarly, visualizations provide a high level view of the data in addition to important trends and patterns.
The data set cr_loan has already been loaded in the workspace.

Plot a histogram of loan_amnt within the data.
# Look at the distribution of loan amounts with a histogram
n, bins, patches = plt.hist(x=cr_loan['loan_amnt'], bins='auto', color='blue',alpha=0.7, rwidth=0.85)
plt.xlabel("Loan Amount")
plt.show()










Create a scatter plot of a person's income and age. In this case, income is the independent variable and age is the dependent variable.
print("There are 32 000 rows of data so the scatter plot may take a little while to plot.")

# Plot a scatter plot of income against age
plt.scatter(cr_loan['person_income'], cr_loan['person_age'],c='blue', alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Personal Income')
plt.ylabel('Persone Age')
plt.show()


<script.py> output:
    There are 32 000 rows of data so the scatter plot may take a little while to plot.


Starting with data exploration helps us keep from getting a.head() of ourselves! We can already see a positive correlation with age and income, which could mean these older recipients are further along in their career and therefore earn higher salaries. There also appears to be an outlier in the data.
