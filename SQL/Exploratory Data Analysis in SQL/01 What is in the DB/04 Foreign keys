Foreign keys
Recall that foreign keys reference another row in the database via a unique ID. Values in a foreign key column are restricted to values in the referenced column OR NULL.
Using what you know about foreign keys, why can't the tag column in the tag_type table be a foreign key that references the tag column in the stackoverflow table?
Remember, you can reference the slides using the icon in the upper right of the screen to review the requirements for a foreign key.


#NOT - stackoverflow.tag is not a primary key
Foreign keys often reference primary keys, but it isn't a requirement. What feature of primary keys is a requirement?

#NOT - tag_type.tag contains NULL values
Foreign key column can contain NULL to indicate no relationship.

#NOT - tag_type.tag does not contain all the values in stackoverflow.tag
A foreign key column can only contain values in the referenced column, but it does not need to contain all of them.

#YES - stackoverflow.tag contains duplicate values
Brillant! Foreign keys must reference a column with unique values for each row so the referenced row can be identified.
