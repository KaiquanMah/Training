Join tables
Part of exploring a database is figuring out how tables relate to each other. The company and fortune500 tables don't have a formal relationship between them in the database, but this doesn't prevent you from joining them.
To join the tables, you need to find a column that they have in common where the values are consistent across the tables. Remember: just because two tables have a column with the same name, it doesn't mean those columns necessarily contain compatible data. If you find more than one pair of columns with similar data, you may need to try joining with each in turn to see if you get the same number of results.
Reference the entity relationship diagram if needed.

Look at the contents of the company and fortune500 tables. Find a column that they have in common where the values for each company are the same in both tables.
Join the company and fortune500 tables with an INNER JOIN.
Select only company.name for companies that appear in both tables.

SELECT company.name
-- Table(s) to select from
FROM company
INNER JOIN fortune500
--Check the first entry in the left operand of the binary expression =. The checker expected to find company.ticker in there.
--ON company.name=fortune500.name;
ON company.ticker=fortune500.ticker;
