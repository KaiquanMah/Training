Coalesce
The coalesce() function can be useful for specifying a default or backup value when a column contains NULL values.
coalesce() checks arguments in order and returns the first non-NULL value, if one exists.
coalesce(NULL, 1, 2) = 1
coalesce(NULL, NULL) = NULL
coalesce(2, 3, NULL) = 2
In the fortune500 data, industry contains some missing values. Use coalesce() to use the value of sector as the industry when industry is NULL. Then find the most common industry.


Use coalesce() to select the first non-NULL value from industry, sector, or 'Unknown' as a fallback value.
Alias the result of the call to coalesce() as industry2.
Count the number of rows with each industry2 value.
Find the most common value of industry2.
-- Use coalesce
SELECT coalesce(industry, sector, 'Unknown') AS industry2,
       -- Don't forget to count!
       COUNT(*) 
  FROM fortune500
-- Group by what? (What are you counting by?)
 GROUP BY industry2
-- Order results to see most common first
 ORDER BY COUNT DESC
-- Limit results to get just the one value you want
 LIMIT 1;
 
 
 
 
 industry2	count
Utilities: Gas and Electric	22

 
Terrific! coalesce is essential when the value you need could be in more than one column. In the next exercise, you'll use coalesce as part of a self join.
