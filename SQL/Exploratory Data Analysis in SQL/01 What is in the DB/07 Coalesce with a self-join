Coalesce with a self-join
You previously joined the company and fortune500 tables to find out which companies are in both tables. Now, also include companies from company that are subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies as well.
To include subsidiaries, you will need to join company to itself to associate a subsidiary with its parent company's information. To do this self-join, use two different aliases for company.
coalesce will help you combine the two ticker columns in the result of the self-join to join to fortune500.

Join company to itself to add information about a company's parent to the original company's information.
Use coalesce to get the parent company ticker if available and the original company ticker otherwise.
INNER JOIN to fortune500 using the ticker.
Select original company name, fortune500 title and rank.

SELECT company_original.name, fortune500.title, fortune500.rank
  -- Start with original company information
  FROM company AS company_original
       -- Join to another copy of company with parent
       -- company information
	   LEFT JOIN company AS company_parent
       ON company_original.parent_id = company_parent.id 
       -- Join to fortune500, only keep rows that match
       INNER JOIN fortune500 
       -- Use parent ticker if there is one, 
       -- otherwise original ticker
       ON coalesce(company_parent.ticker, 
                   company_original.ticker) = 
             fortune500.ticker
 -- For clarity, order by rank
 ORDER BY rank;
