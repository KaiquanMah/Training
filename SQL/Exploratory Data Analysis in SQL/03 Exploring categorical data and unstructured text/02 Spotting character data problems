Which of the following is NOT an issue you see with the values of street?
The street suffix (e.g. Street, Avenue) is sometimes abbreviated
House/street numbers sometimes appear in the column
Capitalization is not consistent across values
All of the above are potential problems

#YES - There are sometimes extra spaces at the beginning and end of values
Correct! street values do not have extra spaces. You could verify this with a LIKE query.
