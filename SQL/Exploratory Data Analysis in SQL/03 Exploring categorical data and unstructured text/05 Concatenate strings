Concatenate strings
House number (house_num) and street are in two separate columns in evanston311. Concatenate them together with concat() with a space in between the values.


Concatenate house_num, a space ' ', and street into a single value using the concat().
Use a trim function to remove any spaces from the start of the concatenated value.

-- and trim spaces from the start of the result
SELECT LTRIM(CONCAT(house_num, ' ', street), ' ') AS address

Great! When joining values that might be NULL with a separator between them, consider using the concat_ws() function, which you can read about in the PostgreSQL documentation, to avoid duplicate or unnecessary separators in the result.
