Create a table with indicator variables
Determine whether medium and high priority requests in the evanston311 data are more likely to contain requesters' contact information: an email address or phone number.

Emails contain an @.
Phone numbers have the pattern of three characters, dash, three characters, dash, four characters. For example: 555-555-1212.
Use LIKE to match these patterns. Remember % matches any number of characters (even 0), and _ matches a single character. Enclosing a pattern in % (i.e. before and after your pattern) allows you to locate it within other text.

For example, '%___.com%'would allow you to search for a reference to a website with the top-level domain '.com' and at least three characters preceding it.
Create and store indicator variables for email and phone in a temporary table. LIKE produces True or False as a result, but casting a boolean (True or False) as an integer converts True to 1 and False to 0. This makes the values easier to summarize later.





Create a temp table indicators from evanston311 with three columns: id, email, and phone.
Use LIKE comparisons to detect the email and phone patterns that are in the description, and cast the result as an integer with CAST().
Your phone indicator should use a combination of underscores _ and dashes - to represent a standard 10-digit phone number format.
Remember to start and end your patterns with % so that you can locate the pattern within other text!

You made it through! You not only created new variables but also used them successfully to learn about the data. Medium and high priority requests do contain contact information more frequently.
