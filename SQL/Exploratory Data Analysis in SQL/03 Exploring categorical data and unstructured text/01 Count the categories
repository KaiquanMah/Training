You came twice to check on it including taking a water sample and 'listening' at the street shut off valve.  You did not detect a leak.   Since then we have had three plumbers in to look at the problem.  We scoped the sewer line, one listened at the interior shut off, and we turned off the building water to see if it affected the pumping.  All negative.  The sump pump continues to run every 90 seconds 24/7, and we have one flood when the pump was accidentally turned off.  This current drought has not affected it either.   We are not sure what you can do but  we know that we have a constant source of water entering the sump, which one of the plumbers said would probably rule out a sewer line leak.  We are a 20 unit condo building.  This water is coming from somewhere, but our water bill suggests it is not an internal leak, as well as the other tests.  We thought you should know.
1849204	MEDIUM	Iframe	Trees-Fallen limb or tree	2016-08-22 09:07:45+00:00	2016-08-24 07:05:32+00:00	Lincoln St	1183-1223	null	This isn't about a fallen tree or tree limb but I didn't know how else to categorize it this.  The sidewalk on the north side of Lincoln Street, east and the North Shore Sanitary Canal and west of Chandler Newberger is becoming difficult to use because of the overgrowth bushes and weeds on the edge of the Canal Shores golf course.  The vegetation and branches are growing out over the sidewalk.  Please have a crew (from the City or the golf course) trim there to make the sidewalk more useable, especially now that kids are back in school, walking on this sidewalk to/from Orrington and Haven.  Thanks!

1972582	MEDIUM	Iframe	Dead Animal on Public Property	2016-09-19 01:46:41+00:00	2016-09-27 11:28:50+00:00	Crain St	1524	null	This is not public property but I need help.   There's a raccoon in my back yard that I'm pretty sure has distemper.  It was staggering around and when I went out with a flashlight to see what was going on, it went under bushes on right side of my garage and I need help.   I cannot afford to hire a commercial wild animal removal service.   They charge over $100 and I simply don't have it.   If that raccoon has distemper, which I'm sure it has ( or maybe it has rabies -both distemper and rabies make animals stagger), it's a public health concern.   I live in a two flat and my upstairs neighbor has a child and I have cats, and there are lots of pets in this area.   Although pets should be vaccinated for distemper, not everyone does that, which means this sick raccoon could be a risk to people's pets, given that distemper is  an air borne disease.   I need help.   My phone number is 847-693-0038.   Again, I cannot afford to hire a service to remove it.   I called a few and they charge over $100 to remove a raccoon.  I don't have that and neither does my upstairs neighbor.   Please help me.  The raccoon is inside my back yard on the side of the garage where there are a lot of bushes, near the side door of the garage.   I will be home until 10am.   You can go into my back yard without my permission, please just get that poor, very sick raccoon.
