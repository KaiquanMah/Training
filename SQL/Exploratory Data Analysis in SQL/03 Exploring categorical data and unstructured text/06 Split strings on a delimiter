Split strings on a delimiter
The street suffix is the part of the street name that gives the type of street, such as Avenue, Road, or Street. In the Evanston 311 data, sometimes the street suffix is the full word, while other times it is the abbreviation.
Extract just the first word of each street value to find the most common streets regardless of the suffix.
To do this, use
split_part(string_to_split, delimiter, part_number)


Use split_part() to select the first word in street; alias the result as street_name.
Also select the count of each value of street_name.
-- Select the first word of the street value
SELECT split_part(street, ' ', 1) AS street_name, 
       count(*)
FROM evanston311
GROUP BY street_name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 20;
