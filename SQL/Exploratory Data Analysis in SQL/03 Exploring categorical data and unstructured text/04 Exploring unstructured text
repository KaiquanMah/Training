Exploring unstructured text
The description column of evanston311 has the details of the inquiry, while the category column groups inquiries into different types. How well does the category capture what's in the description?

LIKE and ILIKE queries will help you find relevant descriptions and categories. Remember that with LIKE queries, you can include a % on each side of a word to find values that contain the word. For example:
SELECT category
  FROM evanston311
 WHERE category LIKE '%Taxi%';
 
% matches 0 or more characters.
