Summarize group statistics
Sometimes you want to understand how a value varies across groups. For example, how does the maximum value per group vary across groups?
To find out, first summarize by group, and then compute summary statistics of the group results. One way to do this is to compute group values in a subquery, and then summarize the results of the subquery.
For this exercise, what is the standard deviation across tags in the maximum number of Stack Overflow questions per day? What about the mean, min, and max of the maximums as well?


Start by writing a subquery to compute the max() of question_count per tag; alias the subquery result as maxval.
Then compute the standard deviation of maxval with stddev().
Compute the min(), max(), and avg() of maxval too.

-- Compute standard deviation of maximum values
SELECT STDDEV(maxval),
	   -- min
       MIN(maxval),
       -- max
       MAX(maxval),
       -- avg
       AVG(maxval)
-- Subquery to compute max of question_count by tag
FROM (SELECT MAX(question_count) AS maxval
          FROM stackoverflow
         -- Compute max by...
         GROUP BY tag) AS max_results; -- alias for subquery
         
         



stddev	        min	  max	    avg
176458.37952720	30	1138658	52652.433962264151

Great job summarizing! A subquery was necessary here because the tag maximums must be computed before you can summarize them.
