Generate series
Summarize the distribution of the number of questions with the tag "dropbox" on Stack Overflow per day by binning the data.

Recall:
generate_series(from, to, step)
You can reference the slides using the PDF icon in the upper right corner of the screen.


Start by selecting the minimum and maximum of the question_count column for the tag 'dropbox' so you know the range of values to cover with the bins.
-- Select the min and max of question_count
SELECT MIN(question_count), 
       MAX(question_count)
-- From what table?
FROM stackoverflow
-- For tag dropbox
WHERE tag = 'dropbox';

min	max
2315	3072











Next, use generate_series() to create bins of size 50 from 2200 to 3100.
To do this, you need an upper and lower bound to define a bin.
This will require you to modify the stopping value of the lower bound and the starting value of the upper bound by the bin width.
-- Create lower and upper bounds of bins
SELECT generate_series(2200 , 3050, 50) AS lower,
       generate_series(2250 , 3100, 50) AS upper;

lower	upper
2200	2250
2250	2300
2300	2350
2350	2400
2400	2450
2450	2500
2500	2550
2550	2600
2600	2650
2650	2700
2700	2750
2750	2800
2800	2850
2850	2900
2900	2950
2950	3000
3000	3050
3050	3100














Select lower and upper from bins, along with the count of values within each bin bounds.
To do this, you'll need to join 'dropbox', which contains the question_count for tag "dropbox", to the bins created by generate_series().
The join should occur where the count is greater than or equal to the lower bound, and strictly less than the upper bound.
-- Bins created in Step 2
WITH bins AS (
      SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower,
             generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper),
     -- Subset stackoverflow to just tag dropbox (Step 1)
     dropbox AS (
      SELECT question_count 
        FROM stackoverflow
       WHERE tag='dropbox') 


-- Select columns for result
-- What column are you counting to summarize?
SELECT lower, upper, count(question_count) 
FROM bins  -- Created above
       -- Join to dropbox (created above), 
       -- keeping all rows from the bins table in the join
       LEFT JOIN dropbox
       -- Compare question_count to lower and upper
         ON question_count >= lower 
        AND question_count < upper
-- Group by lower and upper to count values in each bin
GROUP BY lower, upper
-- Order by lower to put bins in order
ORDER BY lower;

generate_series allows you to group values into any size interval and also include ranges with zero values.
