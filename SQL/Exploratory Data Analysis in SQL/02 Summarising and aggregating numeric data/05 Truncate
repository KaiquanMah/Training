Truncate
Use trunc() to examine the distributions of attributes of the Fortune 500 companies.


Remember that trunc() truncates numbers by replacing lower place value digits with zeros:
trunc(value_to_truncate, places_to_truncate)
Negative values for places_to_truncate indicate digits to the left of the decimal to replace, while positive values indicate digits to the right of the decimal to keep.



Use trunc() to truncate employees to the 100,000s (5 zeros).
Count the number of observations with each truncated value.
-- Truncate employees
SELECT trunc(employees, -5) AS employee_bin,
       -- Count number of companies with each truncated value
       COUNT(*)
FROM fortune500
-- Use alias to group
GROUP BY employee_bin
-- Use alias to order
ORDER BY employee_bin;



employee_bin	count
0	433
100000	35
200000	20
300000	7
400000	4
2300000	1









Repeat step 1 for companies with < 100,000 employees (most common).
This time, truncate employees to the 10,000s place.
-- Truncate employees
SELECT trunc(employees, -4) AS employee_bin,
       -- Count number of companies with each truncated value
       COUNT(*)
FROM fortune500
-- Limit to which companies?
WHERE employee_bin < 100000
-- Use alias to group
GROUP BY employee_bin
-- Use alias to order
ORDER BY employee_bin;

-- Truncate employees
SELECT trunc(employees, -4) AS employee_bin,
       -- Count number of companies with each truncated value

FROM fortune500

-- Use alias to group

employee_bin	count
0	102
10000	108
20000	63
30000	42
40000	35
50000	31
60000	18
70000	18
80000	6
90000	10

Start exploring a distribution by grouping values into large bins, then refine as needed for ranges of values where there are a lot of observations.
