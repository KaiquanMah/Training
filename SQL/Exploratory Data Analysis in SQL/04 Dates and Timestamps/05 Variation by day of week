Variation by day of week
Does the time required to complete a request vary by the day of the week on which the request was created?

We can get the name of the day of the week by converting a timestamp to character data:
to_char(date_created, 'day') 

But character names for the days of the week sort in alphabetical, not chronological, order. To get the chronological order of days of the week with an integer value for each day, we can use:
EXTRACT(DOW FROM date_created)
DOW stands for "day of week."


Select the name of the day of the week the request was created (date_created) as day.
Select the mean time between the request completion (date_completed) and request creation as duration.
Group by day (the name of the day of the week) and the integer value for the day of the week (use a function).
Order by the integer value of the day of the week using the same function used in GROUP BY.

-- Select name of the day of the week the request was created 
SELECT to_char(date_created, 'day') AS day, 
       -- Select avg time between request creation and completion
       AVG(date_completed - date_created) AS duration

-- integer value of day of week the request was created
GROUP BY day, EXTRACT(DOW FROM date_created)
-- Order by integer value of the day of the week 
-- the request was created
ORDER BY EXTRACT(DOW FROM date_created);

Terrific! Requests created at the beginning of the work week are closed sooner on average than those created at the end of the week or on the weekend.
