Longest gap
What is the longest time between Evanston 311 requests being submitted?

Recall the syntax for lead() and lag():
lag(column_to_adjust) OVER (ORDER BY ordering_column)
lead(column_to_adjust) OVER (ORDER BY ordering_column)


Select date_created and the date_created of the previous request using lead() or lag() as appropriate.
Compute the gap between each request and the previous request.
Select the row with the maximum gap.
-- Compute the gaps
WITH request_gaps AS (
        SELECT date_created,
               -- lead or lag
               lag(date_created) OVER (ORDER BY date_created) AS previous,
               -- compute gap as date_created minus lead or lag
               date_created - lag(date_created) OVER (ORDER BY date_created) AS gap
          FROM evanston311)


-- Select the row with the maximum gap
SELECT *
  FROM request_gaps
-- Subquery to select maximum gap from request_gaps
 WHERE gap = (SELECT MAX(gap)
                FROM request_gaps);
                
                

date_created	            previous	                  gap
2018-01-07 18:41:34+00:00	2018-01-05 18:04:09+00:00	  2 days, 0:37:25

Hooray! This query uses a WITH clause because we need to refer to request_gap twice to select the row with the maximum value.
