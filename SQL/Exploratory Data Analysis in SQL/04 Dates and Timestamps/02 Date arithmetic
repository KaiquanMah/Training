Date arithmetic
You can subtract dates or timestamps from each other.

You can add time to dates or timestamps using intervals. An interval is specified with a number of units and the name of a datetime field. For example:

'3 days'::interval
'6 months'::interval
'1 month 2 years'::interval
'1 hour 30 minutes'::interval
Practice date arithmetic with the Evanston 311 data and now().





Subtract the minimum date_created from the maximum date_created.
-- Subtract the min date_created from the max
SELECT MAX(date_created) - MIN(date_created)
FROM evanston311;

?column?
911 days, 16:33:39



Using now(), find out how old the most recent evanston311 request was created.
-- How old is the most recent request?
SELECT NOW() - MAX(date_created)
FROM evanston311;

?column?
585 days, 21:53:49.517713



Add 100 days to the current timestamp.
-- Add 100 days to the current timestamp
SELECT NOW() + '100 days'::interval;

?column?
2020-05-16 14:31:02.430666+00:00




Select the current timestamp and the current timestamp plus 5 minutes.
-- Select the current timestamp, 
-- and the current timestamp + 5 minutes
SELECT NOW(), NOW()+ '5 minutes'::interval;

now	?column?
2020-02-06 14:33:01.630024+00:00	2020-02-06 14:38:01.630024+00:00


Fantastic! The 's' at the of 'minutes' is optional. The query will work with or without it.
