Generating descriptive date parts
DATENAME() is an interesting and easy to use function. When you create reports, for example, you may want to show parts of a date in a more understandable manner (i.e. January instead of 1). This is when the DATENAME() function proves its value. This function will return a string value with a description of the date part you are interested in.
In this exercise, you will become familiar with DATENAME(), by using it to retrieve different date parts. You will work with the first_vote_date column from the voters table.
