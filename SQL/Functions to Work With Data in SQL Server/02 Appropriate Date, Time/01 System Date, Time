Get the know the system date and time functions
The purpose of this exercise is for you to work with the system date and time functions and see how you can use them in SQL Server. Whether you just want to discover what day it is or you are performing complex time analysis, these functions will prove to be very helpful in many situations.

In this exercise, you will familiarize yourself with the most commonly used system date and time functions. These are:

Higher Precision
SYSDATETIME()
SYSUTCDATETIME()
SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()

Lower Precision
GETDATE()
GETUTCDATE()
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP






Use the most common date function for retrieving the current date.
SELECT 
	GETDATE() AS CurrentDate;

CurrentDate
2020-02-08 12:45:11.317000




Select the current date in UTC time (Universal Time Coordinate) using two different functions.
SELECT 
	SYSUTCDATETIME() AS UTC_HighPrecision,
	GETUTCDATE() AS UTC_LowPrecision;

UTC_HighPrecision	UTC_LowPrecision
2020-02-08 12:46:00.388026	2020-02-08 12:46:00.387000








Select the local system's date, including the timezone information.
SELECT 
	SYSDATETIMEOFFSET() AS Timezone;

Timezone
2020-02-08 12:47:09.7164914 +00:00


Right on! You should remember that, even if most of the time, you can just use GETDATE() for retrieving the system's date and time, sometimes you may need more precise data. For those scenarios it's useful to know the high-precision date and time functions.
