Arithmetic operations with dates
In this exercise, you will perform arithmetic operations on dates in two different ways: using the arithmetic operators ("+" and "-") and also using the DATEDIFF() function. You will use these variables:
DECLARE @date1 datetime = '2018-12-01';
DECLARE @date2 datetime = '2030-03-03';
Create a SELECT statement, in which to perform the following operations:

Subtract @date1 from @date2.
Add @date1 to @date2.
Using DATEDIFF(), calculate the difference in years between the results of the subtraction and the addition above.
What is the result returned by the DATEDIFF() function?

DECLARE @date1 datetime = '2018-12-01';
DECLARE @date2 datetime = '2030-03-03';


SELECT @date2-@date1,
    @date2+@date1,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, @date1, @date2),
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, @date2-@date1, @date2+@date1)


1911-04-04 00:00:00	  2149-01-31 00:00:00	    12      238
You rock! You correctly used both the arithmetic operators between @date1 and @date2 and the way DATEDIFF() is called. Great work!
