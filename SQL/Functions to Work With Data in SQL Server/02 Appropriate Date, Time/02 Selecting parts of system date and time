Selecting parts of the system's date and time
In this exercise, you will retrieve only parts of the system's date and time, focusing on only the date or only the time. You will use the same date and time functions, but you will use CAST() and CONVERT() to transform the results to a different data type.



Use two functions to query the system's local date, without timezone information. Show the dates in different formats.
SELECT 
	CONVERT(VARCHAR(24), SYSDATETIME(), 107) AS HighPrecision,
	CONVERT(VARCHAR(24), GETDATE(), 102) AS LowPrecision;

HighPrecision	LowPrecision
Feb 08, 2020	2020.02.08





Use two functions to retrieve the current time, in Universal Time Coordinate.
SELECT 
	CAST(SYSUTCDATETIME() AS time) AS HighPrecision,
	CAST(GETUTCDATE() AS time) AS LowPrecision;

HighPrecision	  LowPrecision
12:51:18.727524	12:51:18.726666

Nice going! Remember, when you only need parts of the system's datetime, you can convert the result returned by one of these functions to a date or time.
