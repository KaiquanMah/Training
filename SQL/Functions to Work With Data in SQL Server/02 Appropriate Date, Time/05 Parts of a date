Presenting parts of a date
DATENAME() and DATEPART() are two similar functions. The difference between them is that while the former understandably shows some date parts, as strings of characters, the latter returns only integer values.
In this exercise, you will use both of these functions to select the month and weekday of the first_vote_date in different forms.

Extract the month number of the first vote.
Extract the month name of the first vote.
Extract the weekday number of the first vote.
Extract the weekday name of the first vote.


SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name,
   	-- Extract the month number of the first vote
	DATEPART(MONTH,first_vote_date) AS first_vote_month1,
	-- Extract the month name of the first vote
    DATENAME(MONTH,first_vote_date) AS first_vote_month2,
	-- Extract the weekday number of the first vote
	DATEPART(WEEKDAY,first_vote_date) AS first_vote_weekday1,
    -- Extract the weekday name of the first vote
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY,first_vote_date) AS first_vote_weekday2
