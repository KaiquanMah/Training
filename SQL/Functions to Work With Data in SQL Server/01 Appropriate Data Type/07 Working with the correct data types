Working with the correct data types
It’s now time to practice your understanding of various data types in SQL Server and how to convert them from one type to another. In this exercise, you will query the voters table. Remember that this table holds information about the people who provided ratings for the different chocolate flavors.
You are going to write a query that returns information (first name, last name, gender, country, number of times they voted) about the female voters from Belgium, who voted more than 20 times.
You will work with columns of different data types and perform both implicit and explicit conversions between different types of data (using CAST() and CONVERT() functions).
It sounds like a big query, but we will take it step-by-step and you will see the results in no time!


Restrict the query to retrieve only the female voters who voted more than 20 times.
SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	gender,
	country
FROM voters
WHERE country = 'Belgium'
	-- Select only the female voters
	AND gender = 'F'
    -- Select only people who voted more than 20 times   
    AND total_votes > 20;
    

first_name	last_name	gender	country
Angela	Griffin	F 	Belgium
Julie	Becker	F 	Belgium
Jessica	Gonzales	F 	Belgium
Isabella	Price	F 	Belgium
Melissa	Brooks	F 	Belgium
Dawn	Pal	F 	Belgium
Rachael	Prasad	F 	Belgium
Lane	Sacksteder	F 	Belgium
Marco	Tanara	F 	Belgium









Now that we have the data set prepared, let’s make it more user-friendly. Perform an explicit conversion from datetime to varchar(10), to show the dates as yy/mm/dd.
SELECT 
	first_name,
    last_name,
	-- Convert birthdate to varchar(10) and show it as yy/mm/dd. This format corresponds to value 11 of the "style" parameter.
	CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), birthdate	, 11) AS birthdate,
    gender,
    country
FROM voters
WHERE country = 'Belgium' 
    -- Select only the female voters
	AND gender = 'F'
    -- Select only people who voted more than 20 times  
    AND total_votes > 20;


first_name	last_name	birthdate	gender	country
Angela	Griffin	93/03/08	F 	Belgium
Julie	Becker	96/04/21	F 	Belgium
Jessica	Gonzales	93/04/11	F 	Belgium
Isabella	Price	93/05/05	F 	Belgium
Melissa	Brooks	94/05/05	F 	Belgium
Dawn	Pal	94/03/08	F 	Belgium
Rachael	Prasad	95/02/10	F 	Belgium
Lane	Sacksteder	94/04/15	F 	Belgium
Marco	Tanara	94/05/17	F 	Belgium




Let’s now create a comments column that will show the number of votes performed by each person, in the following form: “Voted "x" times.”
SELECT
	first_name,
    last_name,
	-- Convert birthdate to varchar(10) to show it as yy/mm/dd
	CONVERT(varchar(10), birthdate, 11) AS birthdate,
    gender,
    country,
    -- Convert the total_votes number to nvarchar
    'Voted ' + CAST(total_votes AS NVARCHAR) + ' times.' AS comments
FROM voters
WHERE country = 'Belgium'
    -- Select only the female voters
	AND gender = 'F'
    -- Select only people who voted more than 20 times
    AND total_votes > 20;


first_name	last_name	birthdate	gender	country	comments
Angela	Griffin	93/03/08	F 	Belgium	Voted 52 times.
Julie	Becker	96/04/21	F 	Belgium	Voted 189 times.
Jessica	Gonzales	93/04/11	F 	Belgium	Voted 171 times.
Isabella	Price	93/05/05	F 	Belgium	Voted 22 times.
Melissa	Brooks	94/05/05	F 	Belgium	Voted 46 times.
Dawn	Pal	94/03/08	F 	Belgium	Voted 85 times.
Rachael	Prasad	95/02/10	F 	Belgium	Voted 154 times.
Lane	Sacksteder	94/04/15	F 	Belgium	Voted 169 times.
Marco	Tanara	94/05/17	F 	Belgium	Voted 119 times.
