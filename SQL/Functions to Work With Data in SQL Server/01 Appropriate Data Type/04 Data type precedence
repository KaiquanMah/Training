Data type precedence
In this exercise, you will evaluate the rating information from the ratings table and you will see what happens when a decimal value is compared to an integer. Remember: in SQL Server, data is implicitly converted behind the scenes from one type to another, in such a way that no data loss occurs.


Select information about all the ratings that were higher than 3.
SELECT 
	bean_type,
	rating
FROM ratings
WHERE rating>3;


bean_type	rating
Unknown	3.2500
Trinitario	3.2500
Unknown	3.2500
Unknown	3.5000
Trinitario	3.5000
Trinitario	3.5000
Trinitario	3.5000
Criollo	3.5000

Taking into account that the rating column is a decimal, which statement is true about the execution of this query?
The values from the rating column are converted to int, because int has higher precedence than decimal.
No conversion is performed because decimal and integer numbers can be compared as they are.

#YES - The integer value is converted to decimal because decimal has higher precedence than int.
That is correct! When comparing decimals to integers, the integer value is automatically converted to a decimal. Otherwise, the data after the decimal point would get lost.
