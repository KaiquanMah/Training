Rounding numbers
Sometimes in your database development, you may need to round the results of a calculation. There are three functions you can use for this:
CEILING(expression): rounds-up to the nearest integer value
FLOOR(expression): rounds-down to the nearest integer value
ROUND(expression, length): rounds the expression to the specified length.

In this exercise, you will get familiar with the rounding functions, by applying them on a query based on the ratings table.



Round up the ratings to the nearest integer value.
SELECT
	rating,
	-- Round-up the rating to an integer value
	CEILING(rating) AS round_up
FROM ratings;

rating	round_up
2.7500	3
2.7500	3
2.7500	3
2.7500	3
...








Round down the ratings to the nearest integer value.
SELECT
	rating,
	-- Round-up the rating to an integer value
	CEILING(rating) AS round_up,
	-- Round-down the rating to an integer value
	FLOOR(rating) AS round_down
FROM ratings;

rating	round_up	round_down
2.7500	3	2
2.7500	3	2
2.7500	3	2
2.7500	3	2
3.0000	3	3
3.0000	3	3
3.0000	3	3
3.2500	4	3
...







Round the ratings to a decimal number with only 1 decimal.
SELECT
	rating,
	-- Round-up the rating to an integer value
	CEILING(rating) AS round_up,
	-- Round-down the rating to an integer value
	FLOOR(rating) AS round_down,
	-- Round the rating value to one decimal
	ROUND(rating, 1) AS round_onedec
FROM ratings;

rating	round_up	round_down	round_onedec
2.7500	3	2	2.8000
2.7500	3	2	2.8000
2.7500	3	2	2.8000
2.7500	3	2	2.8000
3.0000	3	3	3.0000
3.0000	3	3	3.0000
3.0000	3	3	3.0000
3.2500	4	3	3.3000
3.2500	4	3	3.3000
3.2500	4	3	3.3000
3.5000	4	3	3.5000
3.5000	4	3	3.5000
3.5000	4	3	3.5000
3.5000	4	3	3.5000
...








Round the ratings to a decimal number with 2 decimals.
SELECT
	rating,
	-- Round-up the rating to an integer value
	CEILING(rating) AS round_up,
	-- Round-down the rating to an integer value
	FLOOR(rating) AS round_down,
	-- Round the rating value to one decimal
	ROUND(rating, 1) AS round_onedec,
	-- Round the rating value to two decimals
	ROUND(rating, 2) AS round_twodec
FROM ratings;



rating	round_up	round_down	round_onedec	round_twodec
2.7500	3	2	2.8000	2.7500
2.7500	3	2	2.8000	2.7500
2.7500	3	2	2.8000	2.7500
...



Remember, CEILING() and FOOR() functions return integer approximations of a number, while with the ROUND() function you can round to a specified number of decimals.
