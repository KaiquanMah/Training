Extracting the sign and the absolute value
In some situations, you may need to use mathematical functions in your database development. After complex calculations, you may need to check the sign of an expression or its absolute value. The functions provided by SQL Server for these tasks are:
ABS(expression)
SIGN(expression)

In this exercise, you will work with the following variables:
DECLARE @number1 DECIMAL(18,2) = -5.4;
DECLARE @number2 DECIMAL(18,2) = 7.89;
DECLARE @number3 DECIMAL(18,2) = 13.2;
DECLARE @number4 DECIMAL(18,2) = 0.003;

The @result variable stores the result of the following calculation: @number1 * @number2 - @number3 - @number4.
You will calculate the absolute value and the sign of this expression.







Calculate the absolute value of the result of the expression.
DECLARE @number1 DECIMAL(18,2) = -5.4;
DECLARE @number2 DECIMAL(18,2) = 7.89;
DECLARE @number3 DECIMAL(18,2) = 13.2;
DECLARE @number4 DECIMAL(18,2) = 0.003;

DECLARE @result DECIMAL(18,2) = @number1 * @number2 - @number3 - @number4;
SELECT 
	@result AS result,
    -- Show the absolute value of the result
	ABS(@result) AS abs_result;

result	abs_result
-55.81	55.81







Find out the sign of the result (positive or negative).
DECLARE @number1 DECIMAL(18,2) = -5.4;
DECLARE @number2 DECIMAL(18,2) = 7.89;
DECLARE @number3 DECIMAL(18,2) = 13.2;
DECLARE @number4 DECIMAL(18,2) = 0.003;

DECLARE @result DECIMAL(18,2) = @number1 * @number2 - @number3 - @number4;
SELECT 
	@result AS result,
	-- Show the absolute value of the result
	ABS(@result) AS abs_result,
	-- Find the sign of the result
	SIGN(@result) AS sign_result;


result	abs_result	sign_result
-55.81	55.81	-1.00


Knowing how to check the sign of a number or calculating its absolute value will come in handy when doing calculations with database information. Remember, the value returned by SIGN() is an indication of whether the number is positive (+1) or negative (-1).
