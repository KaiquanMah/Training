Calculating the length of a string
It is important to know how to calculate the length of the strings stored in a database. You may need to calculate the product with the shortest name or the person with the longest email address.
Calculating the length of a string also proves to be useful in data cleansing and validation tasks. For example, if a business rule is that all product codes must have at least 6 characters, you can easily find the ones that are shorter.
In SQL Server, you can use the LEN() function for calculating the length of a string of characters.
You will use it in this exercise to calculate the location with the longest name from where cocoa beans are used (column broad_bean_origin, from the ratings table).


Calculate the length of each broad_bean_origin.
Order the results from the longest to shortest.
SELECT TOP 10 
	company, 
	broad_bean_origin,
	-- Calculate the length of the broad_bean_origin column
	LEN(broad_bean_origin) AS length
FROM ratings
--Order the results based on the new column, descending
ORDER BY length DESC;



company	broad_bean_origin	length
Raaka	Peru(SMartin-Pangoa-nacional)
	30
Soma	Guat.- D.R.- Peru- Mad.- PNG
	29
Bonnat	Venez-Africa-Brasil-Peru-Mex
	29
Soma	Gre.- PNG- Haw.- Haiti- Mad
	28
La Maison du Chocolat (Valrhona)	Africa- Carribean- C. Am.
	26
L'Amourette	Peru- Ecuador- Venezuela
	25
La Maison du Chocolat (Valrhona)	Ven.- Indonesia- Ecuad.
	24
Theo	Ghana- Panama- Ecuador
	23
Guido Castagna	Ven- Trinidad- Ecuador
	23
Sacred	Central and S. America
	23


Very well, you seem to have gotten the grip on the LEN() function. Can you spot which company corresponds to the longest broad_bean_origin string?
