Looking for a string within a string
If you need to check whether an expression exists within a string, you can use the CHARINDEX() function. This function returns the position of the expression you are searching within the string.
The syntax is: CHARINDEX(expression_to_find, expression_to_search [, start_location])
In this exercise, you are going to use the voters table to search for information about the voters whose names meet several conditions.


Restrict the query to select only the voters whose first name contains the expression "dan".
SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	email 
FROM voters
-- Look for the "dan" expression in the first_name
WHERE CHARINDEX('dan', first_name) > 0;

first_name	last_name	email

Restrict the query to select the voters with "dan" in the first_name and "z" in the last_name.
SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	email 
FROM voters
-- Look for the "dan" expression in the first_name
WHERE CHARINDEX('dan', first_name) > 0 
    -- Look for last_names that contain the letter "z"
	AND CHARINDEX('z', last_name) > 0;

first_name	last_name	email

Restrict the query to select the voters with "dan" in the first_name and DO NOT have the letter "z" in the last_name.
SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	email 
FROM voters
-- Look for the "dan" expression in the first_name
WHERE CHARINDEX('dan', first_name) > 0 
    -- Look for last_names that do not contain the letter "z"
	AND CHARINDEX('z', last_name) = 0;

first_name	last_name	email

Nicely done! What you should remember about CHARINDEX() is that if a match is found, it returns the starting position of the first matching substring, counting from 1. If the substring cannot be found, CHARINDEX() returns 0.
