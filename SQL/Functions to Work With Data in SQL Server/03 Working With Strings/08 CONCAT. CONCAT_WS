Concatenating data
Assembling a string from parts is done quite often in SQL Server. You may need to put together information from different columns and send the result as a whole to different applications. In this exercise, you will get familiar with the different options for concatenating data.
You will create a message similar to this one: "Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400".
The sentence is created by concatenating two string variables with data from the columns bean_origin and cocoa_percent, from the ratings table.
For restricting the number of results, the query will select only values for the company called "Ambrosia" and bean_type is not unknown.


Create a message similar to this one: "Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400" for each result of the query.
Use the + operator to concatenate data and the ' ' character as a separator.
DECLARE @string1 NVARCHAR(100) = 'Chocolate with beans from';
DECLARE @string2 NVARCHAR(100) = 'has a cocoa percentage of';

SELECT 
	bean_type,
	bean_origin,
	cocoa_percent,
	-- Create a message by concatenating values with "+"
	@string1 + ' ' + bean_origin + ' ' + @string2 + ' ' + CAST(cocoa_percent AS nvarchar) AS message1
FROM ratings
WHERE 
	company = 'Ambrosia' 
	AND bean_type <> 'Unknown';


bean_type	bean_origin	cocoa_percent	message1
Trinitario	Belize	0.6400	Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400
Trinitario	Madagascar	0.6600	Chocolate with beans from Madagascar has a cocoa percentage of 0.6600













Create the same message, using the CONCAT() function.
DECLARE @string1 NVARCHAR(100) = 'Chocolate with beans from';
DECLARE @string2 NVARCHAR(100) = 'has a cocoa percentage of';

SELECT 
	bean_type,
	bean_origin,
	cocoa_percent,
	-- Create a message by concatenating values with "+"
	@string1 + ' ' + bean_origin + ' ' + @string2 + ' ' + CAST(cocoa_percent AS nvarchar) AS message1,
	-- Create a message by concatenating values with "CONCAT()"
	CONCAT(@string1, ' ', bean_origin, ' ', @string2, ' ', CAST(cocoa_percent AS nvarchar)) AS message2
FROM ratings
WHERE 
	company = 'Ambrosia' 
	AND bean_type <> 'Unknown';
  
  
  bean_type	bean_origin	cocoa_percent	message1	message2
Trinitario	Belize	0.6400	Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400	Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400
Trinitario	Madagascar	0.6600	Chocolate with beans from Madagascar has a cocoa percentage of 0.6600
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Create the same message, using the CONCAT_WS() function. Evaluate the difference between this method and the previous ones.
DECLARE @string1 NVARCHAR(100) = 'Chocolate with beans from';
DECLARE @string2 NVARCHAR(100) = 'has a cocoa percentage of';

SELECT 
	bean_type,
	bean_origin,
	cocoa_percent,
	-- Create a message by concatenating values with "+"
	@string1 + ' ' + bean_origin + ' ' + @string2 + ' ' + CAST(cocoa_percent AS nvarchar) AS message1,
	-- Create a message by concatenating values with "CONCAT()"
	CONCAT(@string1, ' ', bean_origin, ' ', @string2, ' ', cocoa_percent) AS message2,
	-- Create a message by concatenating values with "CONCAT_WS()"
	CONCAT_WS(' ', @string1, bean_origin, @string2, cocoa_percent) AS message3
FROM ratings
WHERE 
	company = 'Ambrosia' 
	AND bean_type <> 'Unknown';


bean_type	bean_origin	cocoa_percent	message1	message2	message3
Trinitario	Belize	0.6400	Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400	Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400	Chocolate with beans from Belize has a cocoa percentage of 0.6400
Trinitario	Madagascar	0.6600	Chocolate with beans from Madagascar has a cocoa percentage of 0.6600	Chocolate with beans from Madagascar has a cocoa percentage of 0.6600	Chocolate with beans from Madagascar has a cocoa percentage of 0.6600
