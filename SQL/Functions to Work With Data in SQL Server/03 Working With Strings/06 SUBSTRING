Extracting a substring
In this exercise, you will extract parts of a string. You will work with data from the voters table.

There is a built-in function that can help you with this task. The parameters required by this function are:
the expression from which the substring is extracted;
the starting position of the substring
and its length.



Keep in mind that the position of the first character in a string is 1, not 0. This will help you to correctly calculate the starting position of the substring.
Select 5 characters from the email address, starting with position 3.
SELECT 
	email,
    -- Extract 5 characters from email, starting at position 3
	SUBSTRING(email, 3, 5) AS some_letters
FROM voters;

email	some_letters
carol8@yahoo.com	rol8@
ana0@gmail.com	a0@gm

Extract the fruit names from the following sentence: "Apples are neither oranges nor potatoes".
DECLARE @sentence NVARCHAR(200) = 'Apples are neither oranges nor potatoes.'
SELECT
	-- Extract the word "Apples" 
	SUBSTRING(@sentence, 1, 6) AS fruit1,
    -- Extract the word "oranges"
	SUBSTRING(@sentence, 20, 7) AS fruit2;

fruit1	fruit2
Apples	oranges

Nice work! SUBSTRING() is a useful function for selecting only parts of an expression.
