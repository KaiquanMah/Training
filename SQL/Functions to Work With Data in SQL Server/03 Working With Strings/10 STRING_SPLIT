Splitting a string into pieces
Besides concatenating multiple row values, a common task is to split a string into pieces.
Starting with SQL Server 2016, there is a built-in function for achieving this task: STRING_SPLIT(string, separator).
This function splits the string into substrings based on the separator and returns a table, each row containing a part of the original string.
Remember: because the result of the function is a table, it cannot be used as a column in the SELECT clause; you can only use it in the FROM clause, just like a normal table.
In this exercise, you will get familiar with this function.


Split the phrase declared in the variable @phrase into sentences (using the . separator).
DECLARE @phrase NVARCHAR(MAX) = 'In the morning I brush my teeth. In the afternoon I take a nap. In the evening I watch TV.'

SELECT value
FROM STRING_SPLIT(@phrase, '.');


value
In the morning I brush my teeth
 In the afternoon I take a nap
 In the evening I watch TV









Split the phrase declared in the variable @phrase into individual words.
DECLARE @phrase NVARCHAR(MAX) = 'In the morning I brush my teeth. In the afternoon I take a nap. In the evening I watch TV.'

SELECT value
FROM STRING_SPLIT(@phrase, ' ');


value
In
the
morning
I
brush
my
teeth.
In
the
afternoon
I
take
a
nap.
In
the
evening
I
watch
TV.



You are learning a lot! While STRING_SPLIT() is not always very simple to use, it's good to remember that you have a built-in option for when you need to split a larger string into pieces.
