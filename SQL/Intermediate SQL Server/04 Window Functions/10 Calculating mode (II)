Calculating mode (II)
In the last exercise, you created a CTE which assigned row numbers to each unique value in OrderPrice. All you need to do now is to find the OrderPrice with the highest row number.


Use the CTE ModePrice to return the value of OrderPrice with the highest row number.
-- CTE from the previous exercise
WITH ModePrice (OrderPrice, UnitPriceFrequency)
AS
(
	SELECT OrderPrice,
	ROW_NUMBER() 
    OVER (PARTITION BY OrderPrice ORDER BY OrderPrice) AS UnitPriceFrequency
	FROM Orders
)

-- Select the order price from the CTE
SELECT OrderPrice AS ModeOrderPrice
FROM ModePrice
-- Select the maximum UnitPriceFrequency from the CTE
WHERE UnitPriceFrequency IN (SELECT MAX(UnitPriceFrequency) FROM ModePrice)


ModeOrderPrice
32
