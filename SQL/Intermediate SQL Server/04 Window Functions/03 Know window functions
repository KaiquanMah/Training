Do you know window functions?
Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding window queries?


The window functions LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), and LAST_VALUE() require ORDER BY in the OVER() clause.
If the query contains OVER() and PARTITION BY the table is partitioned.
The first row in a window where the LAG() function is used is NULL.

#YES - The standard aggregations like SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT() require ORDER BY in the OVER() clause.
Correct! While you can use ORDER BY in standard aggregations, it is not required.
