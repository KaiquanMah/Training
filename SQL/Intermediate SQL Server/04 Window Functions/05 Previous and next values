Previous and next values
What if you want to shift the values in a column by one row up or down? You can use the exact same steps as in the previous exercise but with two new functions, LEAD(), for the next value, and LAG(), for the previous value. So you follow these steps:
First, create partitions
Then, order by a certain column
Finally, use the LEAD() and/or LAG() functions as per your requirement


Write a T-SQL query that for each territory:
Shifts the values in OrderDate one row down. Call this column PreviousOrder.
Shifts the values in OrderDate one row up. Call this column NextOrder. You will need to PARTITION BY the territory


SELECT TerritoryName, OrderDate, 
       -- Specify the previous OrderDate in the window
       LAG(OrderDate) 
       -- Over the window, partition by territory & order by order date
       OVER(PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY OrderDate) AS PreviousOrder,
       -- Specify the next OrderDate in the window
       LEAD(OrderDate) 
       -- Create the partitions and arrange the rows
       OVER(PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY OrderDate) AS NextOrder
FROM Orders


TerritoryName	OrderDate	PreviousOrder	NextOrder
Australia	2015-02-23 09:00:00	null	2015-02-23 11:00:00
Australia	2015-02-23 11:00:00	2015-02-23 09:00:00	2015-02-23 12:00:00
Australia	2015-02-23 12:00:00	2015-02-23 11:00:00	2015-04-23 02:00:00
