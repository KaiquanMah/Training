Rounding numbers
Sometimes, you only care about the whole dollar amount and want to ignore the decimal values of the cost. In this exercise, you will round the cost to the nearest dollar.


Write a SQL query to round the values in the Cost column to the nearest whole number.
-- Round Cost to the nearest dollar
SELECT Cost, 
       ROUND(Cost, 0) AS RoundedCost
FROM Shipments

Cost	RoundedCost
11.2480	11.0000
10.3976	10.0000
13.2444	13.0000
36.0652	36.0000
15.6100	16.0000
...













Truncating numbers
Since rounding can sometimes be misleading, i.e., $16.8 becomes $17 while $16.4 remains $16, you may want to truncate the values after the decimal instead of rounding them. When you truncate the numbers, both $16.8 and $16.4 remain $16. In this exercise, you will do just that, truncate the Cost column to a whole number.


Write a SQL query to truncate the values in the Cost column to the nearest whole number.
-- Truncate cost to whole number
SELECT Cost, 
       ROUND(Cost, 0, 1) AS TruncateCost
FROM Shipments

Cost	TruncateCost
11.2480	11.0000
10.3976	10.0000
13.2444	13.0000
36.0652	36.0000
