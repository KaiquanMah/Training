Calculating the total
In this chapter, you will use the shipments data. The Shipments table has several columns such as:

MixDesc: the concrete type
Quantity: the amount of concrete shipped
In this exercise, your objective is to calculate the total quantity for each type of concrete used.




Write a T-SQL query which will return the sum of the Quantity column as Total for each type of MixDesc.
-- Write a query that returns an aggregation 
SELECT MixDesc, SUM(Quantity) AS Total
FROM Shipments
-- Group by the relevant column
GROUP BY MixDesc


MixDesc	Total
".40W/C 24"" SPD 5000PSI W/FIBER"	26.533899307250977
"1.0 SACK CLSM 3/8"""	114.50430229306221
"2500 PSI 1/2"" NATURAL"	27.127500534057617
"2500 PSI MAG B W/ASH  3/8"" MOD"	27.496800482273102
"3000 PSI 1"" (.52 W/C RATIO)"	27.089000701904297

Counting the number of rows
In this exercise, you will calculate the number of orders for each concrete type. Since each row represents one order, all you need to is count the number of rows for each type of MixDesc.

Create a query that returns the number of rows for each type of MixDesc.
-- Count the number of rows by MixDesc
SELECT MixDesc, COUNT(MixDesc)
FROM Shipments
GROUP BY MixDesc

MixDesc	
".40W/C 24"" SPD 5000PSI W/FIBER"	1
"1.0 SACK CLSM 3/8"""	6
"2500 PSI 1/2"" NATURAL"	1
"2500 PSI MAG B W/ASH  3/8"" MOD"	2
"3000 PSI 1"" (.52 W/C RATIO)"	1
"3000 PSI 1"" (.52 W/C) FLOW"	2
"3000 PSI 1"" (STAMPED CONCRETE)"	6
