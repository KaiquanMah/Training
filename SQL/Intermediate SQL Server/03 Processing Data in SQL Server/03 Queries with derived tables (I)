Queries with derived tables (I)
The focus of this lesson is derived tables. You can use derived tables when you want to break down a complex query into smaller steps. A derived table is a query which is used in the place of a table. Derived tables are a great solution if you want to create intermediate calculations that need to be used in a larger query.
In this exercise, you will calculate the maximum value of the blood glucose level for each record by age.

Return MaxGlucose from the derived table.
Join the derived table to the main query on Age.
SELECT a.RecordId, a.Age, a.BloodGlucoseRandom, 
-- Select maximum glucose value (use colname from derived table)    
       b.MaxGlucose
FROM Kidney a
-- Join to derived table
JOIN (SELECT Age, MAX(BloodGlucoseRandom) AS MaxGlucose FROM Kidney GROUP BY Age) b
-- Join on Age
ON a.Age = b.Age

RecordId	Age	BloodGlucoseRandom	MaxGlucose
29	0	93	220
71	0	129	220
109	0	0	220
29	0	104	220
113	0	219	220
