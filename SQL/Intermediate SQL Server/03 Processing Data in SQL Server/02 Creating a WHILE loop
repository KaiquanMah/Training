Creating a WHILE loop
In this exercise, you will use the variable you created in the previous exercise you write a WHILE loop. Recall that structure:
WHILE some_condition 

BEGIN 
    -- Perform some operation here
END



Write a WHILE loop that increments counter by 1 until counter is less than 30.
DECLARE @counter INT 
SET @counter = 20



-- Create a loop
WHILE @counter < 30

-- Loop code starting point
BEGIN
	SELECT @counter += 1
-- Loop finish
END



-- Check the value of the variable
SELECT @counter
