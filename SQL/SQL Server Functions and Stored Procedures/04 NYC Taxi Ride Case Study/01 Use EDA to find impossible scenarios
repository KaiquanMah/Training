Use EDA to find impossible scenarios
Calculate how many YellowTripData records have each type of error discovered during EDA.

Use CASE and COUNT to understand how many records contain the following errors:
DropOffDate before PickupDate, DropOffDate before today, PickupDate before today, TripDistance is zero.

SELECT
	-- PickupDate is after today
	COUNT (CASE WHEN PickupDate > GETDATE() THEN 1 END) AS 'FuturePickup',
    -- DropOffDate is after today
	COUNT (CASE WHEN DropOffDate > GETDATE() THEN 1 END) AS 'FutureDropOff',
    -- PickupDate is after DropOffDate
	COUNT (CASE WHEN PickupDate > DropOffDate THEN 1 END) AS 'PickupBeforeDropoff',
    -- TripDistance is 0
	COUNT (CASE WHEN TripDistance = 0 THEN 1 END) AS 'ZeroTripDistance'  
FROM YellowTripData;


FuturePickup	FutureDropOff	PickupBeforeDropoff	ZeroTripDistance
1	              1	              1	                291
