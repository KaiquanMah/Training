Pickup locations by shift
It's time to solve the second objective of the business case. What are the AvgFarePerKM, RideCount and TotalRideMin for each pickup location and shift within a NYC Borough?

Create a stored procedure named cuspPickupZoneShiftStats that accepts @Borough nvarchar(30) as an input parameter and limits records with the matching Borough value.
Calculate the 'Shift' by passing the hour of the PickupDate to the dbo.GetShiftNumber() function. Use the DATEPART function to select only the hour portion of the PickupDate.
Group by PickupDate weekday, shift, and Zone.
Sort by PickupDate weekday (with Monday first), shift, and TotalRideMin.


-- Create the stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.cuspPickupZoneShiftStats
	-- Specify @Borough parameter
	@Borough nvarchar(30)
AS
BEGIN


SELECT
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) as 'Weekday',
    -- Calculate the shift number
	dbo.GetShiftNumber(DATEPART(HOUR, PickupDate)) as 'Shift',
	Zone.Zone as 'Zone',
	FORMAT(AVG(dbo.ConvertDollar(TotalAmount, .77)/dbo.ConvertMiletoKM(TripDistance)), 'c', 'de-de') AS 'AvgFarePerKM',
	FORMAT(COUNT (ID),'n', 'de-de') as 'RideCount',
	FORMAT(SUM(DATEDIFF(SECOND, PickupDate, DropOffDate))/60, 'n', 'de-de') as 'TotalRideMin'
FROM YellowTripData
INNER JOIN TaxiZoneLookup as Zone on PULocationID = Zone.LocationID 
WHERE
	dbo.ConvertMiletoKM(TripDistance) > 0 AND
	Zone.Borough = @Borough
GROUP BY
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate),
    -- Group by shift
	dbo.GetShiftNumber(DATEPART(HOUR, PickupDate)),  
	Zone.Zone
ORDER BY CASE WHEN DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) = 'Monday' THEN 1
              WHEN DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) = 'Tuesday' THEN 2
              WHEN DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) = 'Wednesday' THEN 3
              WHEN DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) = 'Thursday' THEN 4
              WHEN DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) = 'Friday' THEN 5
              WHEN DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) = 'Saturday' THEN 6
              WHEN DATENAME(WEEKDAY, PickupDate) = 'Sunday' THEN 7 END,
         -- Order by shift
         dbo.GetShiftNumber(DATEPART(HOUR, PickupDate)),
         SUM(DATEDIFF(SECOND, PickupDate, DropOffDate))/60 DESC
