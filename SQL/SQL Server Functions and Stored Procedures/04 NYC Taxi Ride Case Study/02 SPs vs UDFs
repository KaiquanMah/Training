SPs vs UDFs
In order to handle errors discovered in EDA we need to understand the differences between UDFs and SPs. Select the statement that is true when comparing UDFs and SPs.

#NOT - UDFs can be used to DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE data outside of the UDF.
"SPs can DELETE, INSERT & UPDATE but not UDFs."

#NOT - UDFs can return output parameters.

#NOT - SPs are required to return a result.

#YES - SPs perform error handling better than UDFS.
"Correct! SPs are actually much more effective at error handling."
