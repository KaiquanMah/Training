Logical weekdays with Hot Deck
Calculate Total Fare Amount per Total Distance for each day of week. If the TripDistance is zero use the Hot Deck imputation function you created earlier in the chapter.

Use DATENAME() and PickupDate to select the day of week.
Use AVG() to calculate TotalAmount per TripDistance, and a CASE statement to select TripDistance if it's more than 0. If not, use dbo.GetTripDistanceHotDeck().
Order by the PickupDate day of week, with 'Monday' appearing first.

SELECT
    -- Select the pickup day of week
	DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) as DayofWeek,
    -- Calculate TotalAmount per TripDistance
	CAST(AVG(TotalAmount/
            -- Select TripDistance if it's more than 0
			CASE WHEN TripDistance > 0 THEN TripDistance
                 -- Use GetTripDistanceHotDeck()
     			 ELSE dbo.GetTripDistanceHotDeck() END) as decimal(10,2)) as 'AvgFare'
FROM YellowTripData
GROUP BY DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate)
-- Order by the PickupDate day of week
ORDER BY
     CASE WHEN DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) = 'Monday' THEN 1
          WHEN DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) = 'Tuesday' THEN 2
          WHEN DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) = 'Wednesday' THEN 3
          WHEN DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) = 'Thursday' THEN 4
          WHEN DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) = 'Friday' THEN 5
          WHEN DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) = 'Saturday' THEN 6
          WHEN DATENAME(weekday, PickupDate) = 'Sunday' THEN 7
END ASC;



DayofWeek	AvgFare
Monday	8.80
Tuesday	9.27
Wednesday	8.74
Thursday	8.25
Friday	9.97
Saturday	8.05
Sunday	7.46

How cool is that! You used your Hot Deck function in a calculation AND can sort by day of the week!
