Find the outliers
The previous exercise showed us that Saturday was the busiest day of the month for BikeShare rides. Do you wonder if there were any individual Saturday outliers that contributed to this?


Use SUM() and DATEDIFF() to find the Total Ride Hours per day starting from seconds.
Use CONVERT() to SELECT the date portion of StartDate.
Use DATENAME() and CONVERT() to select the WEEKDAY.
Use WHERE to only include Saturdays.
SELECT
	-- Calculate TotalRideHours using SUM() and DATEDIFF()
  	SUM(DATEDIFF(SECOND, StartDate, EndDate))/ 3600 AS TotalRideHours,
    -- Select the DATE portion of StartDate
  	CONVERT(DATE, StartDate) AS DateOnly,
    -- Select the WEEKDAY
  	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, CONVERT(DATE, StartDate)) AS DayOfWeek 
FROM CapitalBikeShare
-- Only include Saturday
WHERE DATENAME(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Saturday' 
GROUP BY CONVERT(DATE, StartDate);


TotalRideHours	DateOnly	DayOfWeek
369	2018-03-03	Saturday
599	2018-03-10	Saturday
346	2018-03-17	Saturday
787	2018-03-24	Saturday
1625	2018-03-31	Saturday

Now you know how to use DATENAME(), DATEDIFF() and CONVERT() to find temporal outliers!
