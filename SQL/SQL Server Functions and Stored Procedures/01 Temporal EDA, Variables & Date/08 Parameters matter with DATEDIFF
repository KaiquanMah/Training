Parameters matter with DATEDIFF
How many times, in terms of days, weeks, and months, are the datepart boundaries crossed between the dates 2/26/2018 and 3/3/2018?

SELECT DATEDIFF(DAY, '2/26/2018', '3/3/2018') AS dayDiff
SELECT DATEDIFF(WEEK, '2/26/2018', '3/3/2018') AS weekDiff
SELECT DATEDIFF(MONTH, '2/26/2018', '3/3/2018') AS monthDiff

dayDiff
5
weekDiff
0
monthDiff
1

4 days, 1 week, 0 months.
5 days, 0 weeks, 0 months.
None of the above.

#YES - 5 days, 0 weeks, 1 month.
Now you understand the assumption SQL Server makes when DATEDIFF() calculates the difference between two dates that are in different months.
