Which day of week is busiest?
Now that we verified there are seconds consistently in our dataset we can calculate the Total Trip Time for each day of the week.


Use DATENAME() to SELECT the weekday value for the StartDate.
Use SUM() and DATEDIFF() to calculate TotalTripHours. (beginning with seconds).
Group by the DATENAME() result and summarize TotalTripHours.
Order TotalTripHours in descending order.
SELECT
    -- Select the day of week value for StartDate
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, StartDate) as DayOfWeek,
    -- Calculate TotalTripHours
	SUM(DATEDIFF(SECOND, StartDate, EndDate))/ 3600 as TotalTripHours 
FROM CapitalBikeShare 
-- Group by the day of week
GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY, StartDate)
-- Order TotalTripHours in descending order
ORDER BY TotalTripHours DESC



DayOfWeek	TotalTripHours
Saturday	3728
Thursday	2403
Sunday	2340
Friday	2019
Monday	1826
Tuesday	1053
Wednesday	980

You've now learned how to use DATENAME() and DATEDIFF() to calculate the total trip time for each day of the week.
