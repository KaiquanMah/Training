You need to create a new trigger at the database level that logs modifications to the table TablesChangeLog.
The trigger should fire when tables are created, modified, or deleted.


Create the new trigger following the company's requirements.

-- Create the trigger to log table info
CREATE TRIGGER TrackTableChanges
ON DATABASE
FOR CREATE_TABLE,
	ALTER_TABLE,
	DROP_TABLE
AS
	INSERT INTO TablesChangeLog (EventData, ChangedBy)
    VALUES (EVENTDATA(), USER);
    
    You will have a history of every table interaction from now on.
