Let's see what the newly created trigger does when you try to update some rows in the Orders table.
Run the following script to change the order quantity to 700 for order number 425:
UPDATE Orders SET Quantity = 700 WHERE OrderID = 425;
What happens when you run the code?


Possible Answers
-Nothing. There is no output in the query results pane.

#YES
-The query results pane shows an error thrown by the new trigger.
#Right! The trigger is now preventing you from doing any updates to the Orders table.



-The update is run successfully after the trigger runs.
