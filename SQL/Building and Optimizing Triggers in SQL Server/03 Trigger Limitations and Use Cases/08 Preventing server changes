The company is also asking you to find a method to prevent databases from being mistakenly deleted by employees.
After a detailed analysis, you decide to use a trigger to fulfill the request.
The trigger will roll back any attempts to delete databases.


Create a new trigger called PreventDatabaseDelete.
Attach the trigger at the server level.


-- Create a trigger to prevent database deletion
CREATE TRIGGER PreventDatabaseDelete
-- Attach the trigger at the server level
ON ALL SERVER
FOR DROP_DATABASE
AS
   PRINT 'You are not allowed to remove existing databases.';
   ROLLBACK;



#Your server is now protected from any database deletion attempts.
