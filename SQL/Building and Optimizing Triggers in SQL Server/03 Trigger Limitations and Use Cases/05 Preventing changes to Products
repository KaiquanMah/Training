The Fresh Fruit Delivery company doesn't want regular users to be able to change product information or the actual stock.
Create a new trigger, PreventProductChanges, that prevents any updates to the Products table.

-- Prevent any product changes
CREATE TRIGGER PreventProductChanges
ON Products
INSTEAD OF UPDATE
AS
	RAISERROR ('Updates of products are not permitted. Contact the database administrator if a change is needed.', 16, 1);
  
Well done! An INSTEAD OF trigger can prevent DML statements from being executed. What if you don't always want that? Let's see how it's done in the next exercise.
