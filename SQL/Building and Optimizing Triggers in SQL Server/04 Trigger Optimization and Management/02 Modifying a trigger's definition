A member of the Sales team has noticed that one of the triggers attached to the Discounts table is showing a message with the word "allowed" missing.

Modify the trigger definition and fix the typo without dropping and recreating the trigger.
Add the missing word to the PRINT statement.


-- Fix the typo in the trigger message
ALTER TRIGGER PreventDiscountsDelete
ON Discounts
INSTEAD OF DELETE
AS
	PRINT 'You are not allowed to remove data from the Discounts table.';



When the end goal is to modify an existing trigger, you don't have to delete it and recreate it.
