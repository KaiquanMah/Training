Ordering ETL Tasks
You have been hired to manage data at a small online clothing store. Their system is quite outdated because their only data repository is a traditional database to record transactions.
You decide to upgrade their system to a data warehouse after hearing that different departments would like to run their own business analytics. You reason that an ELT approach is unnecessary because there is relatively little data (< 50 GB).

In the ETL flow you design, different steps will take place. Place the steps in the most appropriate order.

eCommerce API outputs RT txn data
Python script drops null rows and clean data into pre-determined cols
Resulting dataframe is written into an AWS Redshift Warehouse

Nice! In ETL, raw data is cleaned before being stored. This makes it accessible and ready to use.
