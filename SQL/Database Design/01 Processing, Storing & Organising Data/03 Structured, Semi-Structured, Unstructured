Structured, Semi-Structured, Unstructured
In the previous video, you learned about structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Structured data is the easiest to analyze because it is organized and cleaned. On the other hand, unstructured data is schemaless, but scales well. In the middle we have semi-structured data for everything in between.
Each of these cards hold a type of data. Place them in the correct category.


Structured
RDBMS

Semi-Structured
JSON
XML
CSV - CSVs have some structured, but there is no schema enforcing a particular structure.

Unstructured
Text
Images
Audio
Video


From these real-life examples, can you see why unstructured data is easier to scale than structured data?
