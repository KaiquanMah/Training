Querying the snowflake schema
Imagine that you didn't have the data warehouse set up. Instead, you'll have to run this query on the company's operational database, which means you'll have to rewrite the previous query with the following snowflake schema:
The tables in this schema have been loaded. Remember, our goal is to find the amount of money made from the novel genre in each state.
