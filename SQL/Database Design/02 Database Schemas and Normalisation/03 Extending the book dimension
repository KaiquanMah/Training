Extending the book dimension
In the video, we saw how the book dimension differed between the star and snowflake schema. The star schema's dimension table for books, dim_book_star, has been loaded and below is the snowflake schema of the book dimension. 
In this exercise, you are going to extend the star schema to meet part of the snowflake schema's criteria. Specifically, you will create dim_author from the data provided in dim_book_star.


dim_book_star
book_id	title	author	publisher	genre
5550	Evil Under the Sun	Agatha Christie	Harper Collins	mystery
5551	A Murder is Announced	Agatha Christie	Harper Collins	mystery
5552	4.50 From Paddington	Agatha Christie	Harper Collins	mystery
...




Create dim_author with a column for author.
Insert all the distinct authors from dim_book_star into dim_author.
-- Create dim_author with an author column
CREATE TABLE dim_author (
    author VARCHAR(256)  NOT NULL
);

-- Insert authors into the new table
INSERT INTO dim_author
SELECT DISTINCT author FROM dim_book_star;










Alter dim_author to have a primary key called author_id.
Output all the columns of dim_author.
-- Add a primary key 
ALTER TABLE dim_author 
ADD COLUMN author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;

-- Output the new table
SELECT * FROM dim_author;


author	author_id
Octavia E. Butler	1
F. Scott Fitzgerald	2
Beverly Cleary	3
Barack Obama	4
Alice Waters	5
Agatha Christie	6
Steven D. Levitt	7
Alice Walker	8
James Patterson	9
H.G. Wells	10
J.R.R. Tolkien	11
Aldous Huxley	12
Isaac Asimov	13
George R.R. Martin	14
Cecily von Ziegesar	15
Stephenie Meyer	16
Dan Brown	17
David Foster Wallace	18


Awesome! You've created a dimension table that succesfully meets the schema criteria - it has all the authors with no repeats and unique author_ids. If we were to continue completing the star schema, we would need to create tables for the other dimensions using similar code.
