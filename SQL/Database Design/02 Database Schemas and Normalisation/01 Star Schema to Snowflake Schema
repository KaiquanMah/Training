Running from star to snowflake
Remember your running database from last chapter? 
After learning about the snowflake schema, you convert the current star schema into a snowflake schema. To do this, you normalize route_dim and week_dim. Which option best describes the resulting new tables after doing this?
The tables run_fact, route_dim, and week_dim have been loaded.

route_dim
route_id	park_name	city_name	distance_km	route_name
101	Prospect Park	Brooklyn	5	Simple Loop
102	Prospect Park	Brooklyn	10	Grove Run
103	Central Park	New York City	8	Resevoir Loop
...




week_dim
week_id	week	month	year
601	3	May	2019
602	4	May	2019
603	1	June	2019
...




week_dim is extended two dimensions with new tables for month and year. route_dim is extended one dimension with a new table for city.
week_dim is extended three dimensions with new tables for week, month and year. route_dim is extended one dimension with new tables for city and park.

#yes - week_dim is extended two dimensions with new tables for month and year. route_dim is extended two dimensions with new tables for city and park.
Nice! month, year, city, and park are indeed repeated often. year and city would extend month and park, respectively.
