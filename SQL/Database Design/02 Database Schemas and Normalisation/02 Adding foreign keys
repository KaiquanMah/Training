Adding foreign keys
Foreign key references are essential to both the snowflake and star schema. When creating either of these schemas, correctly setting up the foreign keys is vital because they connect dimensions to the fact table. They also enforce a one-to-many relationship, because unless otherwise specified, a foreign key can appear more than once in a table and primary key can appear only once.
The fact_booksales table has three foreign keys: book_id, time_id, and store_id. In this exercise, the four tables that make up the star schema below have been loaded. However, the foreign keys still need to be added. 


dim_store_star
store_id	store_address	city	state	country
798	23 Jeanne Ave	Montreal	Quebec	Canada
799	56 University St	Quebec City	Quebec	Canada
800	23 Verte Ave	Montreal	Quebec	Canada

In the constraint called sales_book, set book_id as a foreign key.
In the constraint called sales_time, set time_id as a foreign key.
In the constraint called sales_store, set store_id as a foreign key.


-- Add the book_id foreign key
ALTER TABLE fact_booksales 
ADD CONSTRAINT sales_book FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES dim_book_star (book_id);
    
-- Add the time_id foreign key
ALTER TABLE fact_booksales 
ADD CONSTRAINT sales_time FOREIGN KEY (time_id) REFERENCES dim_time_star (time_id);
    
-- Add the store_id foreign key
ALTER TABLE fact_booksales 
ADD CONSTRAINT sales_store FOREIGN KEY (store_id) REFERENCES dim_store_star (store_id);

The foreign keys have been added so now we can ensure data consistency whenever new data is inserted to the database.
