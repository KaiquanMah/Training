Converting to 2NF
Let's try normalizing a bit more. In the last exercise, you created a table holding customer_ids and car_ids. This has been expanded upon and the resulting table, customer_rentals, has been loaded for you. Since you've got 1NF down, it's time for 2NF.


customer_rentals
customer_id	car_id	start_date	end_date	model	manufacturer	type_car	condition	color
1453	4KL298	2019-01-08	2019-01-10	 Golf 2017	 Volkswagen	 hatchback	 fair	 blue
1454	5PL4YY	2019-03-18	2019-03-21	 Camaro 2019	 Chevrolet	 convertible	 excellent	 red
1455	5H9OP5	2019-04-14	2019-04-14	 CRV 2018	 Honda	 SUV	 good	 grey
1455	5H9OP5	2019-05-02	2019-05-16	 CRV 2018	 Honda	 SUV	 good	 grey
1455	499ERW	2019-01-12	2019-01-13	 CRV 2018	 Honda	 SUV	 excellent	 black
1456	4KL298	2019-02-17	2019-02-22	 Golf 2017	 Volkswagen	 hatchback	 fair	 blue
1456	4KL298	2019-03-05	2019-03-20	 Golf 2017	 Volkswagen	 hatchback	 fair	 blue


Why doesn't customer_rentals meet 2NF criteria?
#NOT - Because the end_date doesn't depend on all the primary keys.
Try again. end_date depends on the customer, the avaiability of the car, and when the renting started (e.g., the three primary keys).


#NOT - Because there can only be at most two primary keys.
Try again. A 2NF table can have more than two keys as long as a certain condition is met.


#YES - Because there are non-key attributes describing the car that only depend on one primary key, car_id.










Create a new table for the non-key columns that were conflicting with 2NF criteria.
Drop those non-key columns from customer_rentals.
-- Create a new table to satisfy 2NF
CREATE TABLE cars (
  car_id VARCHAR(256) NULL,
  model VARCHAR(128),
  manufacturer VARCHAR(128),
  type_car VARCHAR(128),
  condition VARCHAR(128),
  color VARCHAR(128)
);


-- Drop columns in customer_rentals to satisfy 2NF
ALTER TABLE customer_rentals
DROP COLUMN model,
DROP COLUMN manufacturer,
DROP COLUMN type_car,
DROP COLUMN condition,
DROP COLUMN color;


There we go! model, manufacturer, type_car, conditions, and colors depend on car_id, but are independent of the other two primary keys, customer_id and start_date. The customer or start date cannot change these attributes. Hence, we have put these columns in a new table and dropped them from customer_rentals.
