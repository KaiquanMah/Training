Analysing a data integration plan
You're a data analyst in a hospital that wants to make sure there is enough cough medicine should an epidemic break out. For this, you need to combine the historical health records with the upcoming appointments to see if you can detect a pattern similar to the last cold epidemic. Then, you need to make sure there is sufficient stock available or if the stock should be increased. To help tackle this problem, you created a data integration plan.
Which risk is not clearly indicated on the data integration plan?


It is unclear if you took data governance into account.
You didn't clearly show where your data originated from.
If data is lost during ETL you will not find out.


#RISK - You should indicate that you plan to anonymize patient health records.
Correct! When working with sensitive data it is important to think about permissions. By default you should have the same access rights before and after data integration. If part of the data is essential, it should be anonymized, in this case you can keep the illnesses but remove identifying information.
