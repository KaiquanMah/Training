Partitioning and Normalisation
In the video, you saw the differences between the two types of partitioning: vertical and horizontal partitioning. As you'd expect, the names suggest how these different strategies work.
It might be a bit challenging to distinguish normalization, which you saw in previous chapters, from partitioning.
Can you classify the characteristics in the correct bucket?


Normalisation
Reduce redundancy in the table
Change the logical data model

Vertical Partitioning
Move specific cols to a slower medium
Move the 3rd + 4th cols to a separate table

Horizontal Partitioning  
Sharding is an extension of this, across multiple machines
Use timestamp to move rows from Q4 to a specific table

Partitioning is related to the physical data model. It does not change the logical data model, while normalization does.
