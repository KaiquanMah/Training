Deciding when to use a SQL versus NoSQL DBMS depends on the kind of information you’re storing and the best way to store it. Both types store data, they just store data differently.
When is it better to use a SQL DBMS?

#YES - You are concerned about data consistency and 100% data integrity is your top goal.
The strength of SQL DBMSs lies in using integrity constraints to maintain data consistency across multiple tables.
