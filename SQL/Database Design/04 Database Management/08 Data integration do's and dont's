Data integration do's and dont's
You just learned a lot about data integration, let's check your understanding of the concepts.
Categorize the following items as being True or False when talking about data integration.


True
Be able to access the desired data through a single view does not mean all data has to be stored together
Source data can be stored in multiple/different physical locations
Source data can be in different formats and DBMS
Data integration should be business driven - which combo of data would be useful for biz
Be careful in choosing a hand-coded sol due to maintenance costs
Data in the final view can be updated in different intervals



False
Your data integration sol, ETL tool should work once it is built and then reusable to run queries forever in your resulting view
You should choose whichever sol is right for the job right now
All your data has to be updated in RT in the final view
After data integration, all data should be in a single table
Automated testing + proactive alerts not required
Everybody has access to sensitive data in the final view


You should choose a solution that’s scalable in case your database grows, so you don’t have to do the same job every other quarter. 
A data integration solution should be a long term solution giving you insights over a longer period of time.
