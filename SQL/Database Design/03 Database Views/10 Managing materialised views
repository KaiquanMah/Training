Managing materialised views
Why do companies use pipeline schedulers, such as Airflow and Luigi, to manage materialized views?


To set up a data warehouse and make sure tables have the most up-to-date data.
To convert non-materialized views to materialized views.
To prevent the creation of new materialized views when there are too many dependencies.

#YES - To refresh materialized views with consideration to dependences between views.
Exactly! These pipeline schedulers help visualize dependencies and create a logical order for refreshing views.
