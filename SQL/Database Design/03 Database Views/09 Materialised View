Creating and refreshing a materialised view
The syntax for creating materialized and non-materialized views are quite similar because they are both defined by a query. One key difference is that we can refresh materialized views, while no such concept exists for non-materialized views. It's important to know how to refresh a materialized view, otherwise the view will remain a snapshot of the time the view was created.
In this exercise, you will create a materialized view from the table genre. A new record will then be inserted into genre. To make sure the view has the latest data, it will have to be refreshed.

Create a materialized view called genre_count that holds the number of reviews for each genre.
Refresh genre_count so that the view is up-to-date.
-- Create a materialized view called genre_count 
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW genre_count AS
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) 
FROM genres
GROUP BY genre;

INSERT INTO genres
VALUES (50000, 'classical');

-- Refresh genre_count
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW genre_count;

SELECT * FROM genre_count;
genre	count
global	217
experimental	1815
metal	860
null	2367
classical	1
electronic	3874
folk/country	685
pop/r&b	1432
jazz	435
rap	1559
rock	9436



If we didn't include that REFRESH statement, genre_count would not have a row for the classical genre since that genre did not exist before our INSERT statement.
