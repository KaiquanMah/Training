Working with statistical aggregate functions
SQL Server offers several aggregate functions for statistical purpose. The AVG() function generates the mean of a sample. STDEV() and STDEVP() give us the standard deviation of a sample and of a population, respectively. VAR() and VARP() give us the variance of a sample and a population, respectively. These are in addition to the aggregate functions we learned about in the previous exercise, including SUM(), COUNT(), MIN(), and MAX().
In this exercise, we will look once more at incident rollup and incident type data, this time for quarter 2 of calendar year 2020. We would like to get an idea of how much spread there is in incident occurrence--that is, if we see a consistent number of incidents on a daily basis or if we see wider swings.


Fill in the missing aggregate functions. For standard deviation and variance, use the sample functions rather than population functions.

You may notice the two different values for mean, based on whether our input expression is an integer or a decimal value. Unlike standard deviation and variance, the mean in SQL Server will not automatically cast the input expression as a numeric type beforehand.
