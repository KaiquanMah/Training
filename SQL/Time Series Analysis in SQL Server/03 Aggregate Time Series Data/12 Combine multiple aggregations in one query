Combine multiple aggregations in one query
In the last three exercises, we walked through the ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS grouping operators. Of these three, GROUPING SETS is the most customizable, allowing you to build out exactly the levels of aggregation you want. GROUPING SETS makes no assumptions about hierarchy (unlike ROLLUP) and can remain manageable with a good number of columns (unlike CUBE).

In this exercise, we want to test several conjectures with our data:
We have seen fewer incidents per month since introducing training in November of 2019.
More incidents occur on Tuesday than on other weekdays.
More incidents occur on weekends than weekdays.



Fill out the grouping sets based on our conjectures above. We want to see the following grouping sets in addition to our grand total:
One set by calendar year and month
One set by the day of the week
One set by whether the date is a weekend or not

SELECT
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarMonth,
	c.DayOfWeek,
	c.IsWeekend,
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS
(
    -- Include each non-aggregated column at least once
  	-- Calendar year and month
	(c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarMonth),
  	-- Day of week
	(c.DayOfWeek),
  	-- Is weekend or not
	(c.IsWeekend),
    -- This remains empty; it gives us the grand total
	()
)
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarMonth,
	c.DayOfWeek,
	c.IsWeekend;
  
  
  



CalendarYear	CalendarMonth	DayOfWeek	IsWeekend	NumberOfIncidents
null	null	null	null	3756
null	null	null	false	2677
null	null	null	true	1079
null	null	1	null	536
null	null	2	null	535
null	null	3	null	539
null	null	4	null	522
null	null	5	null	586
null	null	6	null	495
null	null	7	null	543
2019	7	null	null	315
2019	8	null	null	331
2019	9	null	null	372
2019	10	null	null	319
2019	11	null	null	356
2019	12	null	null	311
2020	1	null	null	229
2020	2	null	null	310
2020	3	null	null	284
2020	4	null	null	312
2020	5	null	null	309
2020	6	null	null	308



It looks like weekends (day 1 and day 7) are not appreciably worse than weekdays and that Tuesday (day 3) is not definitely worse than other weekdays. There might be something to the training conjecture, but we would need further analysis to see if the drop is just noise.
