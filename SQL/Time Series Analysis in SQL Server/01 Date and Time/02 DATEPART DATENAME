Break a date and time into component parts
Although YEAR(), MONTH(), and DAY() are helpful functions and are easy to remember, we often want to break out dates into different component parts such as the day of week, week of year, and second after the minute. This is where functions like DATEPART() and DATENAME() come into play.
Here we will use the night the Berlin Wall fell, November 9th, 1989.


Using the DATEPART() function, fill in the appropriate date parts. For a list of parts, review https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datepart-transact-sql
DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';

-- Fill in each date part
SELECT
	DATEPART(YEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,
	DATEPART(MONTH, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheMonth,
	DATEPART(DAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDay,
	DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATEPART(WEEK, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATEPART(SECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATEPART(NANOSECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;


TheYear	TheMonth	TheDay	TheDayOfYear	TheDayOfWeek	TheWeek	TheSecond	TheNanosecond
1989	11	9	313	5	45	36	229485200











Using the DATENAME() function, fill in the appropriate function calls.
DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';

-- Fill in the function to show the name of each date part
SELECT
	DATENAME(YEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,
	DATENAME(MONTH, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheMonth,
	DATENAME(DAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDay,
	DATENAME(DAYOFYEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATENAME(WEEK, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATENAME(SECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATENAME(NANOSECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;
  

TheYear	TheMonth	TheDay	TheDayOfYear	TheDayOfWeek	TheWeek	TheSecond	TheNanosecond
1989	November	9	313	Thursday	45	36	229485200







How many DATENAME() results differ from their DATEPART() counterparts?
Two
Great! The only two date parts which differ are MONTH and WEEKDAY, which return locale-sensitive string results for DATENAME() and numeric values for DATEPART().
