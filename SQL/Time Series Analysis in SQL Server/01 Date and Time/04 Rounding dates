Rounding dates
SQL Server does not have an intuitive way to round to the nearest value, such as the nearest month, hour, or minute. You can, however, combine the DATEADD() and DATEDIFF() functions to perform this rounding.
To round the date 1914-08-16 to the nearest year, we would call DATEADD(YEAR, DATEDIFF(YEAR, 0, '1914-08-16'), 0). To round that date to the nearest month, we would call DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, '1914-08-16'), 0). This works for several other date parts as well.


Use DATEADD() and DATEDIFF() in conjunction with date parts to round our time to the nearest day, hour, and minute.
DECLARE
	@SomeTime DATETIME2(7) = '2018-06-14 16:29:36.2248991';

-- Fill in the appropriate functions and date parts
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToDay,
	DATEADD(HOUR, DATEDIFF(HOUR, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToHour,
	DATEADD(MINUTE, DATEDIFF(MINUTE, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToMinute;



RoundedToDay	RoundedToHour	RoundedToMinute
2018-06-14 00:00:00	2018-06-14 16:00:00	2018-06-14 16:29:00
One thing to note is that DATEDIFF() returns an integer type, so it can overflow if you try to round to seconds. It could overflow when rounding to minutes, but that will be after the year 5000 so we're safe for now.
