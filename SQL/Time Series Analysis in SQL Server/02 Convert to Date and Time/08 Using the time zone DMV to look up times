Using the time zone DMV to look up times
The SWITCHOFFSET() function has an undesirable limitation: you need to know the offset value yourself. You might memorize that US Eastern Standard Time is UTC -5:00 and Eastern Daylight Time is UTC -04:00, but knowing India Standard Time or Tuvalu Time might be a stretch.
Fortunately, we have a Dynamic Management View (DMV) available to help us: sys.time_zone_info. This searches the set of time zones available on the operating system (in the Windows registry or /usr/share/zoneinfo on Linux or macOS).
The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro started at 11 PM UTC on August 8th, 2016. Starting with a string containing that date and time, we can see what time that was in other locales knowing only the time zone name but not its offset.


Fill in the appropriate function call and offset value column, which is current_utc_offset.
Fill in the correct Dynamic Management View call.
Fill in the time zone for New Delhi, India, which is India Standard Time.
DECLARE
	@OlympicsUTC NVARCHAR(50) = N'2016-08-08 23:00:00';

SELECT
	-- Fill in the function call and offset value
	SWITCHOFFSET(@OlympicsUTC, tzi.current_utc_offset) AS NewDelhiTime
-- Fill in the DMV name
FROM sys.time_zone_info AS tzi
WHERE
	-- Fill in the time zone name
	tzi.name = N'India Standard Time';

NewDelhiTime
2016-08-09 04:30:00.0000000 +05:30


NOTE: the sys.time_zone_info DMV returns the current offset from UTC, so 'Eastern Standard Time' will actually be 'Eastern Daylight Time' when the is_currently_dst flag is set.
