Build dates and times with offsets from parts
The DATETIMEOFFSETFROMPARTS() function builds a DATETIMEOFFSET out of component values. It has the most input parameters of any date and time builder function.
On January 19th, 2038 at 3:14:08 AM UTC, we will experience the Year 2038 (or Y2.038K) problem. This is the moment that 32-bit devices will reset back to the date 1900-01-01. This runs the risk of breaking every 32-bit device using POSIX time, which is the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 at midnight UTC.


Build a DATETIMEOFFSET which represents the last millisecond before the Y2.038K problem hits. The offset should be UTC.
Build a DATETIMEOFFSET which represents the moment devices hit the Y2.038K issue in UTC time. Then use the AT TIME ZONE operator to convert this to Eastern Standard Time.

	-- Fill in the millisecond PRIOR TO chaos
	DATETIMEOFFSETFROMPARTS(2038, 01, 19, 3, 14, 07, 999, 0, 0, 3) AS LastMoment,
    -- Fill in the exact millisecond chaos begins
    -- Then convert to the Eastern Standard Time time zone
	DATETIMEOFFSETFROMPARTS(2038, 01, 19, 3, 14, 08, 0, 0, 0, 3) AT TIME ZONE 'Eastern Standard Time' AS TimeForChaos;


LastMoment	TimeForChaos
2038-01-19 03:14:07.9990000 +00:00	2038-01-18 22:14:08.0000000 -05:00

The DATETIMEOFFSETFROMPARTS() function takes in a large number of parameters, but when you need to build a DATETIMEOFFSET type from component parts, it is available. This might be needed in cases where date parts are stored in separate columns or fields.
