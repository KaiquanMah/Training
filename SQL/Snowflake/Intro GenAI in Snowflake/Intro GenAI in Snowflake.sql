How accurate are Snowflake Cortex AI‚Äôs translation and sentiment analysis functions?
Cortex AI leverages large language models (LLMs) for translation and sentiment analysis, providing high accuracy. 
However, results may vary based on
- CONTEXT,
- LANGUAGE complexity, and
- INDUSTRY-specific jargon.
It‚Äôs recommended to validate outputs for critical business applications.


  
Can I integrate Snowflake Cortex AI with other AI services or external tools?
Yes! You can combine Cortex AI functions with
- Snowpark to build advanced ML workflows or 
- integrate it into Tableau or PowerBI to VIZ insights

  
What are some best practices for using Snowflake Cortex AI efficiently?
- Optimize queries by SELECTING ONLY NECESSARY text FIELDS.
- PREPROCESS text data to REMOVE NOISE before applying AI functions.
- Use CACHING and INDEXING for frequently accessed text summaries.
- MONITOR query COSTS to avoid unnecessary compute usage.

It was the last night of our road trip and we wanted 
to treat ourselves and stay somewhere a bit nicer. 
We stayed out of season so it was affordable. 
Beautiful hotel and great service.
We called prior to arriving to ask about parking. 
They said not to worry and they would park the car when we arrived.
They didn't; however tell us parking was 45euro a night. 
That is my only criticism. We could have moved the car
but we felt a bit embarrassed so we left it there for the night (we didn't want to look cheap). 
Loved the hotel I just think they should be a bit clearer about that 
sort of cost because it really did add to the price of our stay as a couple 
who don't often frequent five-star hotels. 
Otherwise; lovely staff. We felt very welcome.

On our last night of the road trip, we stayed at an expensive hotel with great service, but were surprised by a 45 euro nightly parking fee, which was not disclosed beforehand. 
Despite this, we enjoyed the hotel and the staff were welcoming.

Generating responses with AI_COMPLETE()
In this exercise, you'll use the AI_COMPLETE() function in SQL to generate batch responses for multiple reviews.
Note: No packages need to be installed - AI_COMPLETE() works natively in SQL cells.

1,2023-06-22,4,We booked two rooms for a family of 4. One of the rooms had such a strong cigarette smell that it was unbearable to sleep in. 3 of us ended up squeezing in one room and I didn‚Äôt sleep the whole night because of the strong smell.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en
2,2023-06-14,4,We arrived at the hotel after midnight and they said there was no room for us; despite a confirmed reservation.  We had called up earlier in the day to say that we wouldn‚Äôt arrive until after midnight and they had said ‚Äòno problem‚Äô.  The management was very apologetic and found us a room (very small) in a nearby hotel; but we were less than pleased!,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en
3,2023-06-02,2,DONT STAY HERE. INSECTS IN THE BED. If I could share ZERO stars; I would. I checked into this hotel on the night of 29 May. I was escorted to a room with a door smaller than the rest of the rooms in the hallway; only wide enough for my one checked luggage to fit through. I requested to be moved to the proper room; which they obliged; but only after claiming this was technically an upgrade (IT WASNT ‚Äî it is the room I originally paid for. A classic room). Nonetheless; i didnt complain. As I got ready for bed; I moved the pillows and blanket out of place only to find 8-10 small insects buried underneath (see photo of what it looked like). These insects also flew on me throughout the night. I called the reception and told them id like to check out and request a refund and they said I would have to handle this with Expedia; who I booked and prepaid the four nights with. There were also no available hotels at that time for me to go to (it was midnight). I waited until day break and went down to the reception to tell them what happened. They very nonchalantly told me there were flies during this time of year. Upon calling expedia to resolve the matter and get my money back for the nights i didnt stay there; the hotel refused. DONT STAY HERE unless you want bugs in your hair and clothes. I‚Äôm still waiting for Expedia to get back to me on resolving the issue. So disappointed in how well this hotel is rated on Expedia.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en
4,2023-02-24,4,The hotel‚Äôs fine.  But they outrageously added minbar items to my bill and charged me after i‚Äôd left the hotel.  They won‚Äôt acknowledge my queries on this.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

0,We paid more to stay in this hotel due to the kids pool area; amenities and reviews however once there; the gym was closed and in construction; kids pool area inactive (picture taken from the top of the hotel and the kids pool section is closed). The room had drainage issue in the bathtub and sink and took them 2 days to try to fix it without success. We kept requesting to change room without success and gave up to avoid further stress. Food was ok but not the best. The daily activity journal we only received on the last two days (we stayed 5 days) and on the date of the activity that makes you loose the morning free activity if you are interested. I would suggest to put the journal on the day before in the room when they set up the beds. The beach area is restricted and if you like to have a walk; choose another hotel. Overall unfortunately; I would not recommend the hotel that is pricey for what they offer.

df = cell1.to_pandas()
review = df["DESCRIPTION"].iloc[0]

print(review)

# Import the relevant function
from snowflake.cortex import extract_answer

# Find out what the main issue was
response = extract_answer(

    "score": 0.72192985  
  }  
]


score is between 0 and 1
A score of 1 indicates absolute certainty, so this is quite unlikely.
Anything below approx 0.7 might suggest that a human review would be beneficial, as the model is not particularly confident in how well it has answered your question.

This was my second time at the Majestic - the outside of the hotel is lovely; lobby is gilded and elegant; and Le Fouquet is nice but over the top expensive; but unless you get a modernized room; be prepared to be very disappointed.
