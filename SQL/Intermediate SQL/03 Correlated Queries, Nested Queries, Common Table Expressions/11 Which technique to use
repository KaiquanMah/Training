Which technique to use?
The previous three exercises demonstrated that, in many cases, you can use multiple techniques in SQL to answer the same question.
Based on what you learned, which of the following statements is NOT true regarding differences in the use and performance of multiple/nested subqueries, correlated subqueries, and common table expressions?


Correlated subqueries can allow you to circumvent multiple, complex joins.
Common table expressions are declared first, improving query run time.
Multiple or nested subqueries are processed first, before your main query.

#YES - Correlated subqueries can reduce the length of your query, improving query run time.
"Correct! While correlated subqueries can reduce the length of your query, they also significantly increase query run time."
