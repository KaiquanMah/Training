Clean up with CTEs
In chapter 2, you generated a list of countries and the number of matches in each country with more than 10 total goals. The query in that exercise utilized a subquery in the FROM statement in order to filter the matches before counting them in the main query. Below is the query you created:
SELECT
  c.name AS country,
  COUNT(sub.id) AS matches
FROM country AS c
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT country_id, id 
  FROM match
  WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10) AS sub
ON c.id = sub.country_id
GROUP BY country;


You can list one (or more) subqueries as common table expressions (CTEs) by declaring them ahead of your main query, which is an excellent tool for organizing information and placing it in a logical order.
In this exercise, let's rewrite a similar query using a CTE.




Complete the syntax to declare your CTE.
Select the country_id and match id from the match table in your CTE.
Left join the CTE to the league table using country_id.
-- Set up your CTE
WITH match_list AS (
    SELECT 
  		country_id, 
  		id
    FROM match
    WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10)
    
    
-- Select league and count of matches from the CTE
SELECT
    l.name AS league,
    COUNT(match_list.id) AS matches
FROM league AS l
-- Join the CTE to the league table
LEFT JOIN match_list ON l.id = match_list.country_id
GROUP BY l.name;


league	matches
Switzerland Super League	0
Poland Ekstraklasa	0
Netherlands Eredivisie	1
Scotland Premier League	0
France Ligue 1	0
Spain LIGA BBVA	4
Germany 1. Bundesliga	1
Italy Serie A	0
Portugal Liga ZON Sagres	0
England Premier League	3
Belgium Jupiler League	0

Nice job! You just rearranged a query to produce similar results to a subquery in FROM! Isn't this much easier to read?
