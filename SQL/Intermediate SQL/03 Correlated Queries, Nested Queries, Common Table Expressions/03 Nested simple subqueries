Nested simple subqueries
Nested subqueries can be either simple or correlated.
Just like an unnested subquery, a nested subquery's components can be executed independently of the outer query, while a correlated subquery requires both the outer and inner subquery to run and produce results.
In this exercise, you will practice creating a nested subquery to examine the highest total number of goals in each season, overall, and during July across all seasons.


Complete the main query to select the season and the max total goals in a match for each season. Name this max_goals.
Complete the first simple subquery to select the max total goals in a match across all seasons. Name this overall_max_goals.
Complete the nested subquery to select the maximum total goals in a match played in July across all seasons.
Select the maximum total goals in the outer subquery. Name this entire subquery july_max_goals.


SELECT
	-- Select the season and max goals scored in a match
	season,
    MAX(home_goal + away_goal) AS max_goals,
    -- Select the overall max goals scored in a match
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) FROM match) AS overall_max_goals,
   -- Select the max number of goals scored in any match in July
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) 
    FROM match
    WHERE id IN (
            SELECT id 
            FROM match 
            WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 07)) AS july_max_goals
FROM match
GROUP BY season;


season	max_goals	overall_max_goals	july_max_goals
2013/2014	10	11	7
2012/2013	11	11	7
2014/2015	10	11	7
2011/2012	10	11	7

Good job! You just set up a nested subquery inside your main query to get some interesting data.
