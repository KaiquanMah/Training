Get team names with correlated subqueries
Let's solve the same problem using correlated subqueries -- How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?
This can easily be performed using correlated subqueries. But how might that impact the performance of your query? Complete the following steps and let's find out!
Please note that your query will run more slowly than the previous exercise!



Using a correlated subquery in the SELECT statement, match the team_api_id column from team to the hometeam_id from match.
SELECT
    m.date,
   (SELECT team_long_name
    FROM team AS t
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    WHERE m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id) AS hometeam
FROM match AS m;



date	hometeam
2011-07-29	Oud-Heverlee Leuven
2011-07-30	RAEC Mons
2011-07-30	KRC Genk
2011-07-30	KAA Gent
2011-07-30	Sporting Lokeren
2011-07-30	KV Kortrijk
2011-07-30	KV Mechelen
2011-07-31	Club Brugge KV
2011-10-16	Club Brugge KV
2011-10-16	RSC Anderlecht
...










Create a second correlated subquery in SELECT, yielding the away team's name.
Select the home and away goal columns from match in the main query.
SELECT
    m.date,
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam,
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.awayteam_id) AS awayteam,
    -- Select home and away goals
     home_goal,
     away_goal
FROM match AS m;

date	hometeam	awayteam	home_goal	away_goal
2011-07-29	Oud-Heverlee Leuven	RSC Anderlecht	2	1
2011-07-30	RAEC Mons	Standard de Li√®ge	1	1
2011-07-30	KRC Genk	Beerschot AC	3	1
2011-07-30	KAA Gent	KSV Cercle Brugge	0	1
2011-07-30	Sporting Lokeren	SV Zulte-Waregem	0	0
2011-07-30	KV Kortrijk	Lierse SK	1	1
...



Fantastic work! The syntax here is much simpler, but if you're working with a large data set your query may take a while to run!
