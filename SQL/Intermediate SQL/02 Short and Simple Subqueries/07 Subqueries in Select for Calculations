Subqueries in Select for Calculations
Subqueries in SELECT are a useful way to create calculated columns in a query. A subquery in SELECT can be treated as a single numeric value to use in your calculations. When writing queries in SELECT, it's important to remember that filtering the main query does not filter the subquery -- and vice versa.
In the previous exercise, you created a column to compare each league's average total goals to the overall average goals in the 2013/2014 season. In this exercise, you will add a column that directly compares these values by subtracting the overall average from the subquery.


Select the average goals scored in a match for each league in the main query.
Select the average goals scored in a match overall for the 2013/2014 season in the subquery.
Subtract the subquery from the average number of goals calculated for each league.
Filter the main query so that only games from the 2013/2014 season are included.
SELECT
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal),2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Subtract the overall average from the league average
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) - 
		 (SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
		  FROM match 
          WHERE season = '2013/2014'),
         2) AS diff
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Only include 2013/2014 results
WHERE m.season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY l.name;



league	avg_goals	diff
Switzerland Super League	2.89	0.12
Poland Ekstraklasa	2.64	-0.13
Netherlands Eredivisie	3.20	0.43
Scotland Premier League	2.75	-0.02
France Ligue 1	2.46	-0.31
Spain LIGA BBVA	2.75	-0.02
Germany 1. Bundesliga	3.16	0.39
Italy Serie A	2.72	-0.04
Portugal Liga ZON Sagres	2.37	-0.40
England Premier League	2.77	0.00
Belgium Jupiler League	2.50	-0.27


Good job! Games in the Netherlands tend to score the highest number of goals on average in this season. Why do you think that is?
