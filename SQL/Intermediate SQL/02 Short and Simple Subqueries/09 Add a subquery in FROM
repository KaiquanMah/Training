Add a subquery in FROM
In the previous exercise, you created a data set listing the average home and away goals in each match stage of the 2012/2013 match season.
In this next step, you will turn the main query into a subquery to extract a list of stages where the average home goals in a stage is higher than the overall average for home goals in a match.


Calculate the average home goals and average away goals from the match table for each stage in the FROM clause subquery.
Add a subquery to the WHERE clause that calculates the overall average home goals.
Filter the main query for stages where the average home goals is higher than the overall average.
Select the stage and avg_goals columns from the s subquery into the main query.
SELECT 
	-- Select the stage and average goals from the subquery
	s.stage,
	ROUND(s.avg_goals, 2) AS avg_goals
FROM 
	-- Select the stage and average goals in 2012/2013
	(SELECT
		 stage,
         AVG(home_goal + away_goal) AS avg_goals
	 FROM match
	 WHERE season = '2012/2013'
	 GROUP BY stage) AS s
WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query using the subquery
	s.avg_goals > (SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal) 
                    FROM match WHERE season = '2012/2013');
