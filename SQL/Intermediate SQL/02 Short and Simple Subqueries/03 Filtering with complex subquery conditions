Filtering with more complex subquery conditions
In the previous exercise, you generated a list of teams that have no home matches listed in the soccer database using a subquery in WHERE. Let's do some further exploration in this database by creating a list of teams that scored 8 or more goals in a home match.
In order to do this, you will construct a subquery in the WHERE statement with its own filtering condition.

Create a subquery in WHERE clause that retrieves all hometeam_ID values from match with a home_goal score greater than or equal to 8.
Select the team_long_name and team_short_name from the team table. Include all values from the subquery in the main query.
SELECT
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Filter for teams with 8 or more home goals
WHERE team_api_id IN
	  (SELECT hometeam_id 
       FROM match
       WHERE home_goal >= 8);


team_long_name	team_short_name
Manchester United	MUN
Chelsea	CHE
Southampton	SOU
FC Bayern Munich	BMU
Real Madrid CF	REA
FC Barcelona	BAR
