Add a window function
Fantastic! You now have a result set that retrieves the match date, home team, away team, and the goals scored by each team. You have one final component of the question left -- how badly did Manchester United lose in each match?
In order to determine this, let's add a window function to the main query that ranks matches by the absolute value of the difference between home_goal and away_goal. This allows us to directly compare the difference in scores without having to consider whether Manchester United played as the home or away team!
The equation is complete for you -- all you need to do is properly complete the window function!

Set up the CTEs so that the home and away teams each have a name, ID, and score associated with them.
Select the date, home team name, away team name, home goal, and away goals scored in the main query.
Rank the matches and order by the difference in scores in descending order.


-- Set up the home team CTE
WITH home AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),


-- Set up the away team CTE
away AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)


-- Select columns and and rank the matches by date
SELECT DISTINCT
    m.date,
    home.team_long_name AS home_team,
    away.team_long_name AS away_team,
    m.home_goal, m.away_goal,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ABS(home_goal - away_goal) DESC) as match_rank
-- Join the CTEs onto the match table
FROM match AS m
INNER JOIN home ON m.id = home.id
INNER JOIN away ON m.id = away.id
WHERE m.season = '2014/2015'
      AND ((home.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND home.outcome = 'MU Loss')
      OR (away.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND away.outcome = 'MU Loss'));




date	home_team	away_team	home_goal	away_goal	match_rank
2014-08-16	Manchester United	Swansea City	1	2	3
2014-09-21	Leicester City	Manchester United	5	3	2

Awesome! This is an interesting list of matches. You can easily modify this query for any team of your choice. Finally, if you liked this course, let your instructor know by tweeting them at @monakay!
