CASE statements comparing column values
Barcelona is considered one of the strongest teams in Spain's soccer league.
In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012 season where Barcelona was the home team. You will do this using a CASE statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.
In 3 steps, you will build a query that identifies a match's winner, identifies the identity of the opponent, and finally filters for Barcelona as the home team. Completing a query in this order will allow you to watch your results take shape with each new piece of information.
The matches_spain table currently contains Barcelona's matches from the 2011/2012 season, and has two key columns, hometeam_id and awayteam_id, that can be joined with the teams_spain table. However, you can only join teams_spain to one column at a time.


Select the date of the match and create a CASE statement to identify matches as home wins, home losses, or ties.
SELECT 
	-- Select the date of the match
	date,
	-- Identify home wins, losses, or ties
	CASE WHEN home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
         WHEN home_goal < away_goal THEN 'Home loss :(' 
         ELSE 'Tie' 
         END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain;

date	outcome
2012-01-21	Home loss :(
2012-01-22	Home win!
2012-01-22	Home loss :(
2012-01-23	Home win!
2012-01-21	Tie
2012-01-22	Tie
...














Left join the teams_spain table team_api_id column to the matches_spain table awayteam_id. This allows us to retrieve the away team's identity.
Select team_long_name from teams_spain as opponent and complete the CASE statement from Step 1.
SELECT 
	m.date,
	--Select the team long name column and call it 'opponent'
	t.team_long_name AS opponent, 
	-- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
         WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Home loss :('
         ELSE 'Tie' 
         END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
-- Left join teams_spain onto matches_spain
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id;


date	opponent	outcome
2014-10-19	Valencia CF	Home win!
2014-09-28	Valencia CF	Tie
2014-09-22	Valencia CF	Home loss :(

Complete the same CASE statement as the previous steps.
Filter for matches where the home team is FC Barcelona (id = 8634).
SELECT 
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
    -- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
         WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
         ELSE 'Tie' 
         END AS outcome 
FROM matches_spain AS m
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
-- Filter for Barcelona as the home team
WHERE m.hometeam_id = 8634;
