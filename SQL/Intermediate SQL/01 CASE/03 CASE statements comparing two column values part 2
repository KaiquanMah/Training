CASE statements comparing two column values part 2
Similar to the previous exercise, you will construct a query to determine the outcome of Barcelona's matches where they played as the away team. You will learn how to combine these two queries in chapters 2 and 3.
Did their performance differ from the matches where they were the home team?


Complete the CASE statement to identify Barcelona's away team games (id = 8634) as wins, losses, or ties.
Left join the teams_spain table team_api_id column on the matches_spain table hometeam_id column. This retrieves the identity of the home team opponent.
Filter the query to only include matches where Barcelona was the away team.
-- Select matches where Barcelona was the away team
SELECT  
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
         WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
         ELSE 'Tie' 
         END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
-- Join teams_spain to matches_spain
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE m.awayteam_id = 8634;
