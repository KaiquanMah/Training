COUNT using CASE WHEN
Do the number of soccer matches played in a given European country differ across seasons? We will use the European Soccer Database to answer this question.
You will examine the number of matches played in 3 seasons within each country listed in the database. This is much easier to explore with each season's matches in separate columns. Using the country and unfiltered match table, you will count the number of matches played in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 match seasons.

Create a CASE statement that identifies the id of matches played in the 2012/2013 season. Specify that you want ELSE values to be NULL.
Wrap the CASE statement in a COUNT function and group the query by the country alias.
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count games from the 2012/2013 season
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' 
        	THEN m.id ELSE NULL END) AS matches_2012_2013
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;


country	matches_2012_2013
Portugal	240
France	380
Scotland	228
Netherlands	306
Spain	380
Belgium	240
Italy	380
Germany	306
England	380
Switzerland	180
Poland	240










Create 3 CASE WHEN statements counting the matches played in each country across the 3 seasons.
END your CASE statement without an ELSE clause.
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count matches in each of the 3 seasons
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2012_2013,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;

country	matches_2012_2013	matches_2013_2014	matches_2014_2015
Portugal	240	240	306
France	380	380	380
Scotland	228	228	228
Netherlands	306	306	306
Spain	380	380	380
Belgium	240	12	240
Italy	380	380	379
Germany	306	306	306
England	380	380	380
Switzerland	180	180	180
Poland	240	240	240


Fantastic! The number of matches played in each season seems relatively consistent across countries. Where do you see the largest difference?
