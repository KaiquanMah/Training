Update
You may sometimes have to update the rows in a table. For example, in the album table, there is a row with a very long album title, and you may want to shorten it.
You don't want to delete the record - you just want to update it in place. To do this, you need to specify the album_id to ensure that only the desired row is updated and all others are not modified.


Select the title column from the album table where the album_id is 213.
-- Select the album
SELECT 
  title 
FROM 
  album 
WHERE 
  album_id = 213;


title
Pure Cult: The Best Of The Cult (For Rockers Ravers Lovers & Sinners) UK
...







That's a very long album title, isn't it? Use an UPDATE statement to modify the title to 'Pure Cult: The Best Of The Cult'.
-- UPDATE the title of the album
UPDATE 
  album
SET 
  title = 'Pure Cult: The Best Of The Cult'
WHERE album_id = 213;








Hit 'Submit Answer' to see whether or not the album title was shortened!
-- Run the query again
SELECT 
  title 
FROM 
  album ;



title
For Those About To Rock We Salute You
Balls to the Wall
Restless and Wild
Let There Be Rock
Big Ones
Jagged Little Pill
Facelift
...


Remember, when updating, you need to SET the change you want to make and pinpoint the exact rows to change using a WHERE clause.
