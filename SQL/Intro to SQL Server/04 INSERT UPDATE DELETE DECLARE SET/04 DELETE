Delete
You may not have permissions to delete from your database, but it is safe to practice it here in this course!
Remember - there is no confirmation before deleting. When you execute the statement, the record(s) are deleted immediately. Always ensure you test with a SELECT and WHERE in a separate query to ensure you are selecting and deleting the correct records. If you forget so specify a WHERE condition, you will delete ALL rows from the table.


Hit 'Submit Answer' to run the query and view the existing data.
-- Run the query
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  album



album_id	title	artist_id
1	For Those About To Rock We Salute You	1
2	Balls to the Wall	2
3	Restless and Wild	2
4	Let There Be Rock	1
...










DELETE the record from album where album_id is 1 and then hit 'Submit Answer'.
-- DELETE the record
DELETE FROM 
  album 
WHERE 
  album_id = 1 


-- Run the query again
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  album;


album_id	title	artist_id
2	Balls to the Wall	2
3	Restless and Wild	2
4	Let There Be Rock	1
...


Always test with a seperate SELECT query before you DELETE, to ensure you delete the correct records. It's a good idea to comment out the DELETE keyword until you have verified that you have a WHERE clause and it works as intended.
