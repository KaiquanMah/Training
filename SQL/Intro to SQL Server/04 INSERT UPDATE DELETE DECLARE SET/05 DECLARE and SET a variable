DECLARE and SET a variable
Using variables makes it easy to run a query multiple times, with different values, without having to scroll down and amend the WHERE clause each time. You can quickly update the variable at the top of the query instead. This also helps provide greater security, but that is out of scope of this course.
Let's go back to the now very familiar grid table for this exercise, and use it to practice extracting data according to your newly defined variable.


grid_id	description	event_year	event_date	restore_date	nerc_region	demand_loss_mw	affected_customers
1	Severe Weather  Thunderstorms	2014	2014-06-30	2014-07-01	RFC	null	127000
2	Severe Weather  Thunderstorms	2014	2014-06-30	2014-07-01	MRO	424	120000
3	Fuel Supply Emergency  Coal	2014	2014-06-27	null	MRO	null	null
...





DECLARE the variable @region, which has a data type of VARCHAR and length of 10.
-- Declare the variable @region, and specify the data type of the variable
DECLARE @region VARCHAR(10)


SET your newly defined variable to 'RFC'.
-- Update the variable value
SET @region = 'RFC'

SELECT description,
       nerc_region,
       demand_loss_mw,
       affected_customers
FROM grid
WHERE nerc_region = @region;



description	nerc_region	demand_loss_mw	affected_customers
Severe Weather  Thunderstorms	RFC	null	127000
Severe Weather  Thunderstorms	RFC	null	138802
Severe Weather  Thunderstorms	RFC	null	66383
...


Excellent work! You can define more than one variable in your query.
