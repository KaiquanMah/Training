Declare multiple variables
You've seen how to DECLARE and SET set 1 variable. Now, you'll DECLARE and SET multiple variables. There is already one variable declared, however you need to overwrite this and declare 3 new ones. The WHERE clause will also need to be modified to return results between a range of dates.



Declare a new variable called @start of type DATE.
-- Declare @start
DECLARE @start DATE

-- SET @start to '2014-01-24'
SET @start = '2014-01-24'




Declare a new variable called @stop of type DATE.
-- Declare @start
DECLARE @start DATE

-- Declare @stop
DECLARE @stop DATE

-- SET @start to '2014-01-24'
SET @start = '2014-01-24'

-- SET @stop to '2014-07-02'
SET @stop = '2014-07-02'








Declare a new variable called @affected of type INT.
-- Declare @start
DECLARE @start DATE

-- Declare @stop
DECLARE @stop DATE

-- Declare @affected
DECLARE @affected INT

-- SET @start to '2014-01-24'
SET @start = '2014-01-24'

-- SET @stop to '2014-07-02'
SET @stop  = '2014-07-02'

-- Set @affected to 5000
SET @affected = 5000







Retrieve all rows where event_date is BETWEEN @start and @stop and affected_customers is greater than or equal to @affected.
-- Declare your variables
DECLARE @start DATE
DECLARE @stop DATE
DECLARE @affected INT;
-- SET the relevant values for each variable
SET @start = '2014-01-24'
SET @stop  = '2014-07-02'
SET @affected =  5000 ;

SELECT 
  description,
  nerc_region,
  demand_loss_mw,
  affected_customers
FROM 
  grid
-- Specify the date range of the event_date and the value for @affected
WHERE event_date BETWEEN @start AND @stop
AND affected_customers >= @affected;
