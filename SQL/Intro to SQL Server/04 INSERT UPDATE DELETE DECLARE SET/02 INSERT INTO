Insert
This exercise consists of two parts: In the first, you'll create a new table very similar to the one you created in the previous interactive exercise. After that, you'll insert some data and retrieve it.
You'll continue working with the Chinook database here.


Create a table called tracks with 2 VARCHAR columns named track and album, and one integer column named track_length_mins. Then, select all columns from the new table using the * notation.
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE tracks(
	-- Create track column
	track VARCHAR(200),
    -- Create album column
  	album VARCHAR(160),
	-- Create track_length_mins column
	track_length_mins INT
);



-- Select all columns from the new table
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  tracks;







Insert the track 'Basket Case', from the album 'Dookie', with a track length of 3, into the appropriate columns.
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE tracks(
  -- Create track column
  track VARCHAR(200), 
  -- Create album column
  album VARCHAR(160), 
  -- Create track_length_mins column
  track_length_mins INT
);


-- Complete the statement to enter the data to the table         
INSERT INTO tracks
-- Specify the destination columns
(track, album, track_length_mins)
-- Insert the appropriate values for track, album and track length
VALUES
  ('Basket Case', 'Dookie', 3);


-- Select all columns from the new table
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  tracks;


track	album	track_length_mins
Basket Case	Dookie	3
