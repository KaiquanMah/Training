LEN'gth of a string
Knowing the length of a string is key to being able to manipulate it further using other functions, so what better way to start the lesson?
Retrieve the length of the description column, returning the results as description_length.


-- Calculate the length of the description column
SELECT 
  LEN (description) AS description_length 
FROM 
  grid;
  

description_length
29
29
27
26
26
26
29
...

Once we know the length of a string, we can use that information to select portions of it, from either the start or end. We'll look at that now.
