HAVING
WHERE is used to filter rows before any grouping occurs. Once you have performed a grouping operation, you may want to further restrict the number of rows returned. This is a job for HAVING. In this exercise, you will modify an existing query to use HAVING, so that only those results with a sum of over 10000 are returned.



Modify the provided query to remove the WHERE clause.
Replace it with a HAVING clause so that only results with a total demand_loss_mw of greater than 10000 are returned.
SELECT 
  nerc_region, 
  SUM (demand_loss_mw) AS demand_loss 
FROM 
  grid 
  -- Remove the WHERE clause
WHERE demand_loss_mw  IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
  nerc_region 
  -- Enter a new HAVING clause so that the sum of demand_loss_mw is greater than 10000
HAVING 
  SUM(demand_loss_mw) > 10000 
ORDER BY 
  demand_loss DESC;

Try to remember that WHERE is applied before GROUP BY and filters on rows. HAVING is applied after GROUP BY, and filters on the groups or aggregates you created within the query.
