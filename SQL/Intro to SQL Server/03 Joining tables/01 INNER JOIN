Inner Joins - a perfect match
Let's use the Chinook database, which consists of tables related to an online store, to understand how inner joins work. The album table lists albums by multiple artists. The track table lists individual songs, each with a unique identifier, but also, an album_id column that links each track to an album.
Let's find the tracks that belong to each album.


Perform an inner join between album and track using the album_id column.
SELECT 
  track_id,
  name AS track_name,
  title AS album_title
FROM track
  -- Complete the join type and the common joining column
INNER JOIN album on album.album_id = track.album_id;


track_id	track_name	album_title
1	For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)	For Those About To Rock We Salute You

Inner Joins (II)
Here, you'll continue to practice your INNER JOIN skills. We'll use the album table as last time, but will join it to a new table - artist - which consists of two columns: artist_id and name.

Select the album_id and title columns from album (the main source table name).
Select the name column from artist and alias it as artist.
Identify a common column between the album and artist tables and perform an inner join.




-- Select album_id and title from album, and name from artist
SELECT 
  album_id,
  title,
  name AS artist
  -- Enter the main source table name
FROM album
  -- Perform the inner join
INNER JOIN artist on artist.artist_id = album.artist_id;
