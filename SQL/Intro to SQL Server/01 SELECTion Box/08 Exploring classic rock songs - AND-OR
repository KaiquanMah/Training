Exploring classic rock songs - AND-OR
Having familiarized yourself with the songlist table, you'll now extend your WHERE clause from the previous exercise.



Extend the WHERE clause so that the results are those with a release_year greater than or equal to 1980 and less than or equal to 1990.
SELECT song, artist, release_year
FROM songlist 
WHERE 
  -- Retrieve records greater than and including 1980
  release_year >= 1980 
  -- Also retrieve records up to and including 1990
  AND release_year <= 1990 
ORDER BY artist, release_year;






Update your query to use an OR instead of an AND.
SELECT song, artist, release_year
FROM songlist 
WHERE 
  -- Retrieve records greater than and including 1980
  release_year >= 1980 
  -- Replace AND with OR
  OR release_year <= 1990 
ORDER BY artist, release_year;
