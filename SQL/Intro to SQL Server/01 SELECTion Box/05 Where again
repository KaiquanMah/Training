Where again
When filtering strings, you need to wrap your value in 'single quotes', as you did in the previous exercise. You don't need to do this for numeric values, but you DO need to use single quotes for date columns.
In this course, dates are always represented in the YYYY-MM-DD format (Year-Month-Day), which is the default in Microsoft SQL Server.


Select the nerc_region and demand_loss_mw columns, limiting the results to those where affected_customers is greater than or equal to 500000.
-- Select nerc_region and demand_loss_mw
SELECT nerc_region, demand_loss_mw 
FROM grid 
-- Retrieve rows where affected_customers is >= 500000  
WHERE affected_customers >= 500000;

Update your code to select description and affected_customers, returning records where the event_date was the 22nd December, 2013.
-- Select description and affected customers
SELECT description, affected_customers 
FROM grid 
-- Retrieve rows where the event_date was the 22nd December, 2013    
WHERE event_date = '20131222';


-- Select description and affected customers
SELECT description, affected_customers 
FROM grid 
-- Retrieve rows where the event_date was the 22nd December, 2013    
WHERE event_date = '2013-12-22';

Limit the results to those where the affected_customers is BETWEEN 50000 and 150000, and order in descending order of event_date.
-- Select description, affected_customers and event date
SELECT description, affected_customers, event_date
FROM grid 
-- The affected_customers column should be >= 50000 and <=150000   
WHERE affected_customers BETWEEN 50000 AND 150000 
-- Define the order   
ORDER BY event_date DESC;

BETWEEN is a great way to simplify the method of returning values in a range.
