Order by
In this exercise, you'll practice the use of ORDER BY using the grid dataset. It's loaded and waiting for you! It contains a subset of wider publicly available information on US power outages.


Some of the main columns include:
description: The reason/ cause of the outage.
nerc_region: The North American Electricity Reliability Corporation was formed to ensure the reliability of the grid and comprises several regional entities).
demand_loss_mw: How much energy was not transmitted/consumed during the outage.

Select description and event_date from grid. Your query should return the first 5 rows, ordered by event_date.
-- Select the first 5 rows from the specified columns
SELECT TOP 5 description, event_date 
FROM grid 
-- Order your results by the event_date column
ORDER BY event_date;

Modify your code based on the comments provided on the right.
-- Select the top 20 rows from description, nerc_region and event_date
SELECT TOP 20 description, nerc_region, event_date
FROM grid 
-- Order by nerc_region, affected_customers & event_date
-- Event_date should be in descending order
ORDER BY
