Where
You won't usually want to retrieve every row in your database. You'll have specific information you need in order to answer questions from your boss or colleagues.
The WHERE clause is essential for selecting, updating (and deleting!) data from your tables. You'll continue working with the grid dataset for this exercise.


Select the description and event_year columns.
Return rows WHERE the description is 'Vandalism'.
-- Select description and event_year
SELECT description, event_year 
FROM grid 
  -- Filter the results
WHERE description = 'Vandalism';



description	event_year
Vandalism	2014
Vandalism	2013
Vandalism	2013
...


Don't forget to use single quotes when filtering strings.
