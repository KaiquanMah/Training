More selections
Now that you've practiced how to select one column at a time, it's time to practice selecting more than one column. You'll continue working with the eurovision table.



SELECT the country and event_year columns from the eurovision table.
-- Select country and event_year from eurovision
SELECT country, event_year 
FROM eurovision;

country	event_year
Israel	2009
France	2009
Sweden	2009
...





Use a shortcut to amend the current query, returning ALL rows from ALL columns in the table.
-- Amend the code to select all rows and columns
SELECT *
FROM eurovision;

euro_id	event_year	country	gender	group_type	place	points	host_country	host_region	is_final	sf_number	song_in_english
1	2009	Israel	Female	Group	16	53	Away	Away	1	null	1
2	2009	France	Female	Solo	8	107	Away	Away	1	null	0
3	2009	Sweden	Female	Solo	21	33	Away	Away	1	null	1
...





Return all columns, but only include the top half of the table - in other words, return 50 percent of the rows.
-- Return all columns, restricting the percent of rows returned
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * 
FROM eurovision;

We can combine the use of * with TOP to limit the number of rows returned. In the next lesson, you'll learn more powerful methods to restrict the number of rows returned, so that your queries can be applied to specific business questions.
