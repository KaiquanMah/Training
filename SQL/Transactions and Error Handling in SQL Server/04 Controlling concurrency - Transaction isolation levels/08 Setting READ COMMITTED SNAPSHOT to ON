The default isolation level of your database is READ COMMITTED. You made some scripts that were supposed to be run under the READ COMMITTED isolation level.
Now, you want every script you already made to be run with the READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT option set to ON. 
In doing this, each statement under the READ COMMITTED isolation level will see the committed changes that occur before the start of each statement.


Which options do you need to set in your database?
Answer the question
#YES
1
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON and 
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON.
#Remember that the main difference between READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT and the SNAPSHOT isolation level is that with the SNAPSHOT isolation level you can only see the committed changes that occur before the start of a transaction and the changes made by that transaction.

2
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION OFF and 
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON.

3
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT and 
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON.

#NOT
4
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON, 
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT,and 
ALTER DATABASE myDatabaseName SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON.
#Not really. You don't have to set the SNAPSHOT isolation level IN THE MIDDLE.
