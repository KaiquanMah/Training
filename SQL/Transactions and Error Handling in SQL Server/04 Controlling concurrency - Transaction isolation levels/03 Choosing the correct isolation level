Non-repeatable reads occur when a transaction reads a record twice, but the first result is different from the second result as a consequence of another committed transaction altering this data.
From all the isolation levels you have studied so far, which isolation level prevents non-repeatable reads?

Answer the question
1
The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level.

#YES - 2
The REPEATABLE READ isolation level.
