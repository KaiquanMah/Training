You want to prepare a stored procedure to insert new products in the database. In that stored procedure, you want to insert the possible errors in a table called errors, and after that, re-throw the original error.


How do you prepare the stored procedure?
Surround the error handling with a CATCH block.
Insert the error in the errors table.
End the insert statement with a semicolon (;).
Re-throw the original error.







CREATE PROCEDURE insert_product
  @product_name VARCHAR(50),
  @stock INT,
  @price DECIMAL

AS

BEGIN TRY
	INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
		VALUES (@product_name, @stock, @price);
END TRY
-- Set up the CATCH block
BEGIN CATCH
	-- Insert the error and end the statement with a semicolon
    INSERT INTO errors 
    VALUES ('Error inserting a product');
    -- Re-throw the error
	  THROW; 
END CATCH




--errors table
error_id	  error
1	          Error inserting a product



--You have learned how to use the THROW statement without parameters to re-throw an error. Remember that if you use a statement before the THROW statement, you must end that statement with a semicolon.
