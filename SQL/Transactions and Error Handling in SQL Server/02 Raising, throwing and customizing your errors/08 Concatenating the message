You need to prepare a script to select all the information about the members from the staff table using a given first_name.
If the select statement doesn't find any member, you want to throw an error using the THROW statement. You need to warn there is no staff member with such a name.


Assign to @my_message the concatenation of 'There is no staff member with ', with the value of @first_name and with ' as the first name.'.
Use THROW with 50000 as the error number, @my_message as the message parameter, and 1 as the state.
Replace the name 'Pedro' in the DECLARE statement at the beginning with a name that doesn't exist (e.g. 'David') and click Run Code (not Run Solution). You will see the error.
Change again the name to 'Pedro' and run the code without errors.

DECLARE @first_name NVARCHAR(20) = 'David';

-- Concat the message
DECLARE @my_message NVARCHAR(500) =
	CONCAT('There is no staff member with ', @first_name, ' as the first name.');

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM staff WHERE first_name = @first_name)
	-- Throw the error
	THROW 50000, @my_message, 1;
  
  
  
  
  
('42000', '[42000] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]There is no staff member with David as the first name. (50000) (SQLExecDirectW)')

With the use of the CONCAT function, you can create your customized messages and use them in the THROW statement!
