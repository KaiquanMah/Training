You need to prepare a script to select all the information of a member from the staff table using a given staff_id.
If the select statement doesn't find any member, you want to throw an error using the THROW statement. You need to warn there is no staff member with such id.


Use the THROW statement, with 50001 as the error number, 'No staff member with such id' as the message text, and 1 as the state.
Replace the value of @staff_id in the DECLARE statement at the beginning with an identifier that doesn't exist (e.g. '45') and click Run Code (not Run Solution). You will see the error.
Set the value of @staff_id back to 4 and run the code without errors.



DECLARE @staff_id INT = 4;

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM staff WHERE staff_id = @staff_id)
   	-- Invoke the THROW statement with parameters
	THROW 50001, 'No staff member with such id', 1; --error#, 'messageString', state#
ELSE
   	SELECT * FROM staff WHERE staff_id = @staff_id




--query result
staff_id	first_name	  last_name	      email	                        phone

Showing 1 out of 1 rows



--You have learned how to use the THROW statement with parameters. Remember that the THROW statement with parameters can be used both inside or outside a CATCH block.
