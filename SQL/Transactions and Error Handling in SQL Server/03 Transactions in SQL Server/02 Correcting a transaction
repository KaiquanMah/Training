Today you have been given a script which is not correct. It was written by a colleague of yours who didn't know how to finish it. Your colleague tried to transfer $100 from account 1 to account 5, and register those movements into the transactions table.
You immediately realize there are several errors. SQL Server doesn't recognize the transaction statements it uses.

Can you correct the script?
Run the code to verify there are errors.
Correct every error.




--original code
BEGIN TRY  
	START TRAN;
		UPDATE accounts SET current_balance = current_balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
		INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (1, -100, GETDATE());
        
		UPDATE accounts SET current_balance = current_balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 5;
		INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (5, 100, GETDATE());
	FINISH TRAN;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH  
	UNDO TRAN;
END CATCH

--error
('42000', "[42000] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Incorrect syntax near 'START'. (102) (SQLExecDirectW)")














--FIXED CODE
BEGIN TRY  
	BEGIN TRAN
		UPDATE accounts 
		SET current_balance = current_balance - 100 
		WHERE account_id = 1;

		INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (1, -100, GETDATE());
        


		UPDATE accounts 
		SET current_balance = current_balance + 100 
		WHERE account_id = 5;

		INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (5, 100, GETDATE());
	COMMIT TRAN
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH  
	ROLLBACK TRAN;
END CATCH





--Remember that every transaction statement can have either the word TRANSACTION or TRAN.
