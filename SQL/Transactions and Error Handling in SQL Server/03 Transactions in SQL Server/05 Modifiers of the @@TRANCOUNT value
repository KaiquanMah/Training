When there are nested transactions
if @@TRANCOUNT is 1 -> transactions e.g. DELETIONs are committed
if @@TRANCOUNT is >1 -> transactions e.g. DELETIONs are NOT committed


@@TRANCOUNT 
BEGIN TRAN +1 to @@TRANCOUNT 
COMMIT TRAN -1 to @@TRANCOUNT
ROLLBACK TRAN sets @@TRANCOUNT to 0



When we have savepoints
BEGIN TRAN
      ...
      ROLLBACK TRAN savepoint2;
      SELECT @@TRANCOUNT AS '@@Trancount value';
      
      
      ROLLBACK TRAN savepoint1;
      SELECT @@TRANCOUNT AS '@@Trancount value';
      ...
COMMIT TRAN;

@@TRANCOUNT value
------------------
1

^at both instances above
savepoints DO NOT decrease your @@TRANCOUNT










Modifiers of the @@TRANCOUNT value
Which of the following is false about @@TRANCOUNT?

Answer the question
#TRUE
1
The COMMIT TRAN|TRANSACTION statement decrements the value of @@TRANCOUNT by 1.



#YES
#FALSE
2
The COMMIT TRAN|TRANSACTION statement decrements the value of @@TRANCOUNT to 0, except if there is a savepoint.
#That's correct! It is the ROLLBACK TRAN|TRANSACTION statement that decrements the value of @@TRANCOUNT to 0, except if there is a savepoint. (Note that at DC, @@TRANCOUNT starts with a value of 1 instead of 0 because there is 1 internal connection.)




#TRUE
3
The ROLLBACK TRAN|TRANSACTION statement decrements the value of @@TRANCOUNT to 0, except if there is a savepoint.

#TRUE
4
The BEGIN TRAN|TRANSACTION statement increments the value of @@TRANCOUNT by 1.
