What happens if you try to enter NULLs?
Execute the following statement:
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_shortname)
VALUES (NULL, 'Miller', 'ETH');

Why does this throw an error?
Professors without first names do not exist.
Error? This works just fine.
NULL is not put in quotes.



#YES - Because a database constraint is violated.
Correct! This statement violates one of the not-null constraints you've just specified.
