Disallow NULL values with SET NOT NULL
The professors table is almost ready now. However, it still allows for NULLs to be entered. Although some information might be missing about some professors, there's certainly columns that always need to be specified.


Add a not-null constraint for the firstname column.
-- Disallow NULL values in firstname
ALTER TABLE professors 
ALTER COLUMN firstname SET NOT NULL;


firstname	lastname	university_shortname
Karl	Aberer	EPF
Reza Shokrollah	Abhari	ETH







Add a not-null constraint for the lastname column.
-- Disallow NULL values in lastname
ALTER TABLE professors
ALTER COLUMN lastname SET NOT NULL




it is no longer possible to add professors which have either their first or last name set to NULL. Likewise, it is no longer possible to update an existing professor and setting their first or last name to NULL.
