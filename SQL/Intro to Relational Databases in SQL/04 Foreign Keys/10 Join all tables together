Join all the tables together
In this last exercise, you will find the university city of the professor with the most affiliations in the sector "Media & communication".
For this, you need to join all the tables, group by a column, and then use selection criteria to get only the rows in the correct sector.

Join all tables in the database (starting with affiliations, professors, organizations, and universities) and look at the result.

Now group the result by organization sector, professor, and university city.
Count the resulting number of rows.
-- Group the table by organization sector, professor and university city
SELECT COUNT(*), organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors
ON affiliations.professor_id = professors.id
JOIN organizations
ON affiliations.organization_id = organizations.id
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
GROUP BY organizations.organization_sector, 
         professors.id, 
         universities.university_city;

count	organization_sector	id	university_city
1	Not classifiable	47	Basel
2	Media & communication	361	Saint Gallen
1	Education & research	140	Zurich

Only retain rows with "Media & communication" as organization sector, and sort the table by count, in descending order.
-- Filter the table and sort it
SELECT COUNT(*), organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors

ON professors.university_id = universities.id
AND organizations.organization_sector = 'Media & communication'
GROUP BY organizations.organization_sector,

The professor with id 538 has the most affiliations in the "Media & communication" sector, and he or she lives in the city of Lausanne. Thanks to your database design, you can be sure that the data you've just queried is consistent. Of course, you could also put university_city and organization_sector in their own tables, making the data model even more formal. However, in database design, you have to strike a balance between modeling overhead, desired data consistency, and usability for queries like the one you've just wrote. Congratulations, you made it to the end!
