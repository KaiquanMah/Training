Add foreign keys to the "affiliations" table
At the moment, the affiliations table has the structure {firstname, lastname, function, organization}, as you can see in the preview at the bottom right. In the next three exercises, you're going to turn this table into the form {professor_id, organization_id, function}, with professor_id and organization_id being foreign keys that point to the respective tables.
You're going to transform the affiliations table in-place, i.e., without creating a temporary table to cache your intermediate results.

Add a professor_id column with integer data type to affiliations, and declare it to be a foreign key that references the id column in professors.

-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE  affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id INTEGER REFERENCES professors (id);









Rename the organization column in affiliations to organization_id.
-- Rename the organization column to organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
RENAME COLUMN organization TO organization_id;






Add a foreign key constraint on organization_id so that it references the id column in organizations.
-- Add a foreign key on organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id);

Making organization_id a foreign key worked flawlessly because these organizations actually exist in the organizations table. That was only the first part, though. Now it's time to update professor_id in affiliations – so that it correctly refers to the corresponding professors.
