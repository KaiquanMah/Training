Count affiliations per university
Now that your data is ready for analysis, let's run some exemplary SQL queries on the database. You'll now use already known concepts such as grouping by columns and joining tables.
In this exercise, you will find out which university has the most affiliations (through its professors). For that, you need both affiliations and professors tables, as the latter also holds the university_id.

As a quick repetition, remember that joins have the following structure:
SELECT table_a.column1, table_a.column2, table_b.column1, ... 
FROM table_a
JOIN table_b 
ON table_a.column = table_b.column
This results in a combination of table_a and table_b, but only with rows where table_a.column is equal to table_b.column.





professors
id	firstname	lastname	university_id
1	Karl	Aberer	EPF
2	Reza Shokrollah	Abhari	ETH
3	Georges	Abou Jaoud√©	EPF
...

affiliations
function	organization_id	professor_id
NA	CIHA	442
Panel Member 	SNF Ambizione Program	1
Member of Conseil Fondation IDIAP	Fondation IDIAP	1
...


Count the number of total affiliations by university.
Sort the result by that count, in descending order.
-- Count the total number of affiliations per university
SELECT COUNT(*), professors.university_id 
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors
ON affiliations.professor_id = professors.id
-- Group by the university ids of professors
GROUP BY university_id
ORDER BY count DESC;


count	university_id
579	EPF
273	USG
162	UBE
133	ETH
75	UBA
40	UFR
36	UNE
35	ULA
33	UGE
7	UZH
4	USI

As you can see, the count of affiliations is completely different from university to university.
