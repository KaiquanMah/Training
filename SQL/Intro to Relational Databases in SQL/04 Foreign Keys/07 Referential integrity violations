Referential integrity violations
Given the current state of your database, what happens if you execute the following SQL statement?
DELETE FROM universities WHERE id = 'EPF';

It throws an error because the university with ID "EPF" does not exist.
The university with ID "EPF" is deleted.
It fails because referential integrity from universities to professors is violated.

#yes - It fails because referential integrity from professors to universities is violated.
Correct! You defined a foreign key on professors.university_id that references universities.id, so referential integrity is said to hold from professors to universities.
update or delete on table "universities" violates foreign key constraint "professors_fkey" on table "professors"
