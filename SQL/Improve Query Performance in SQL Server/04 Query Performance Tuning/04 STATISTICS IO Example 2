STATISTICS IO Example 2
In the previous exercise, you were asked you to provide a new regional manager daily updates on orders shipped to Western Europe capital cities. You initially created a query that contained two sub-queries. You decide to do a rewrite and use an INNER JOIN.
The STATISTICS IO command is turned on. You will need to turn it off after completing the query.


Add the join operator.
Add the shipping destination city column in the filter condition.
-- Example 2
SELECT c.CustomerID,
       c.CompanyName,
       COUNT(o.CustomerID)
FROM Customers AS c
INNER JOIN Orders AS o -- Join operator
    ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE o.ShipCity IN -- Shipping destination column
     ('Berlin','Bern','Bruxelles','Helsinki',
	 'Lisboa','Madrid','Paris','London')
GROUP BY c.CustomerID,
         c.CompanyName;
