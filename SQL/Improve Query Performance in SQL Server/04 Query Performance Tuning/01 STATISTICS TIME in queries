STATISTICS TIME in queries
A friend is writing a training course on how the command STATISTICS TIME can be used to tune query performance and asks for your help to complete a presentation. He requires two queries that return NBA team details where the host city had a 2017 population of more than two million.
NBA team details can be queried from the NBA Season 2017-2018 database and city populations can be queried by adding in tables from the Earthquakes database.
Each query uses a different filter on the Teams table.

Query 1
Filters the Teams table using IN and three sub-queries
Query 2
Filters the Teams table using EXISTS

Turn on STATISTICS TIME.
SET STATISTICS TIME ON -- Turn the time command on





For Query 1:
Add the filter operator for each sub-query.
Add the table from the Earthquakes database to the first query.
-- FIRST TRY
-- Query 1
SELECT * 
FROM Teams
-- Sub-query 1
WHERE City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
      (SELECT CityName 
       FROM Earthquakes) -- Table from Earthquakes database
-- Sub-query 2
   AND City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
	   (SELECT CityName 
	    FROM Cities
		WHERE CountryCode IN ('US','CA'))
-- Sub-query 3
    AND City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
        (SELECT CityName 
         FROM Cities
	     WHERE Pop2017 >2000000);




-- Check the highlighted code. The checker expected to find Cities in there.
-- SEEMS LIKE THE EXERCISE TABLE HAS CHANGED, YET THE INSTRUCTIONS REMAINED THE SAME
-- SECOND TRY
-- Query 1
SELECT * 
FROM Teams
-- Sub-query 1
WHERE City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
      (SELECT CityName 
       FROM Cities) -- Table from Earthquakes database
-- Sub-query 2
   AND City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
	   (SELECT CityName 
	    FROM Cities
		WHERE CountryCode IN ('US','CA'))
-- Sub-query 3
    AND City IN -- Sub-query filter operator
        (SELECT CityName 
         FROM Cities
	     WHERE Pop2017 >2000000);

Showing 5 out of 5 rows


















For Query 2
Add the filter operator for the sub-query.
Add the two city name columns being compared to the sub-query.

-- Query 2
SELECT * 
FROM Teams AS t
WHERE EXISTS -- Sub-query filter operator
	(SELECT 1 
     FROM Cities AS c
     WHERE t.City = c.CityName -- Columns being compared
        AND c.CountryCode IN ('US','CA')
          AND c.Pop2017 > 2000000);

LAL	Los Angeles Lakers	Los Angeles	CA	Staples Center	18997
HOU	Houston Rockets	Houston	TX	Toyota Center	18055

Showing 5 out of 5 rows

















Turn off STATISTICS TIME.
SET STATISTICS TIME OFF -- Turn the time command off

Great work! Although the time statistics are not displayed in this exercise, in SSMS they are reported for every query executed between running SET STATISTICS TIME ON and SET STATISTICS TIME OFF.
