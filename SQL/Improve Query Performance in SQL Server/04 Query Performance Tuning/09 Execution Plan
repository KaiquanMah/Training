Execution Plan
Test your knowledge of execution plans


Which one of the following is NOT information you can get from an execution plan in SQL Server?
If the query used a table with an index
The location and relative costs of sorting operations
The types of joins used

#YES - The total duration of the query, in milliseconds, from execution to returning the complete results
Correct!!! An execution plan does not provide information about the total duration a query takes to complete. You can, however, get this information from other SQL query performance tuning tools and commands, such as STATISTICS TIME.
