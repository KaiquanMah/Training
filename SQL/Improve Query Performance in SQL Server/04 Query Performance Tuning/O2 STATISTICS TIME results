STATISTICS TIME results
In the previous exercise, the STATISTICS TIME command was used on two different queries. The following table summarizes an analysis of the elapsed time statistics for each query.

Query	Details	                                                Average elapsed time (ms)
1	    Filters the Teams table using IN and three sub-queries	20
2	    Filters the Teams table using EXISTS	                  3

What conclusion can you make from this summary?

None. CPU time is a better measure to compare queries.
None. Elapsed time should be reported as a minimum, not an average.
The database server processors must be running in parallel.

#YES - The second query that uses EXISTS is more efficient.
Great! The WHERE filter condition on the Teams table requires all three sub-queries to be processed whereas EXISTS only processes one.
