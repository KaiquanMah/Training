STATISTICS IO comparison
Using the STATISTICS IO outputs from the example queries in the previous two exercises, what might you conclude?

Example 1
Table 'Customers'. Scan count 1, logical reads 2, physical reads 0,....
Table 'Orders'. Scan count 2, logical reads 32, physical reads 0,...

Example 2
Table 'Customers'. Scan count 1, logical reads 2, physical reads 0,....
Table 'Orders'. Scan count 2, logical reads 16, physical reads 0,...



Nothing. We should use STATISTICS TIME to compare queries and not STATISTICS IO.
The Example 1 query will run faster than the Example 2 query.
The time to return the results from both queries will be the same.

#YES - The Example 2 query will run faster than the Example 1 query.
Awesome! Logical reads are a measure of the number of the 8-kilobyte pages read from memory to process and return the results of your query. In general, the more pages that need to be read the slower your query will run.
