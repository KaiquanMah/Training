Syntax order - Japan earthquakes
Your friend is impressed by your querying skills. She decides to create a query on her own that shows all earthquakes in Japan that were a magnitude of 8 or higher. She has constructed a query based on how she thought about what she requires. Her query will produce an error because of the incorrect ordering of the syntax. Also, the code requires reformatting to make it easy to read.
FROM Earthquakes WHERE Country = 'JP' AND Magnitude >= 8 
SELECT Date, Place ,NearestPop, Magnitude ORDER BY Magnitude DESC;

You will fix the query for her with a better coding format and correct the SQL syntax order.
Rearrange the query with the correct syntax order in the format provided.

-- Your query
SELECT Date, 
    Place,
    NearestPop, 
    Magnitude 
FROM Earthquakes 
WHERE Country = 'JP' 
    AND Magnitude >= 8
ORDER BY Magnitude DESC;


Date	Place	NearestPop	Magnitude
11-Mar-11	near the east coast of Honshu - Japan	Ishinomaki	9.1
2-Mar-33	off the east coast of Honshu - Japan	Kamaishi	8.4
25-Sep-03	Hokkaido - Japan region	Kushiro	8.3

20-Mar-60	off the east coast of Honshu - Japan	Miyako	8

Excellent! You will get an error when you try to run a query that does not have the SQL syntax in the correct order. The results show that Japan has a history of experiencing powerful earthquakes. The March 2011 earthquake was one of the biggest in recorded history, and it created a catastrophic tsunami on its east coast.
