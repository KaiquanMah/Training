Processing Order
The following query returns earthquakes with a magnitude higher than 8, and at a depth of more than 500km.

SELECT Date, Country, Place, Depth, Magnitude
FROM Earthquakes
WHERE Magnitude > 8
    AND Depth > 500
ORDER BY Depth DESC;

Copy and paste the query into the console and select Run Code to view the results.
In which order is the SQL syntax processed in this query?
SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY
FROM, WHERE, SELECT, AND
WHERE, FROM, SELECT, ORDER BY

#YES - FROM, WHERE, SELECT, ORDER BY

Correct! The order of the main processing syntax in this query is; FROM, WHERE, SELECT and ORDER BY. This order is different from the order of the syntax in the query.

Look at the results of the query. The shaking one feels from an earthquake at the earth's surface diminishes the deeper the source of the earthquake. So although these three earthquakes are huge, it's unlikely that they would produce significant shaking, and damage, at the earth's surface.
