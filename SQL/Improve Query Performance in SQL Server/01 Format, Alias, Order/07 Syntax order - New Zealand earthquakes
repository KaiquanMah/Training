Syntax order - New Zealand earthquakes
When executing a query, the processing order of the main SQL syntax is different from the written order in the query.
You want a simple query that returns all the recorded earthquakes in New Zealand that had a magnitude of 7.5 or higher. You think the query out in a sentence before creating it.
From the Earthquakes table, filter for only rows where Country equals 'NZ' and Magnitude greater than or equal to 7.5. Then, select the columns Date, Place, NearestPop, and Magnitude. Order the final results from the largest Magnitude to the smallest Magnitude.
The sample code is arranged in the order that matches the above sentence, which is the same as the SQL syntax processing order in the database. You will need to reorder it so that it runs without error.



Complete the required query using FROM, WHERE, SELECT and ORDER BY.
Rearrange the query so that the syntax is in the order that it will run without error.
/*
Returns earthquakes in New Zealand with a magnitude of 7.5 or more
*/

___ Earthquakes
___ Country = 'NZ'
___ Date, Place, NearestPop, Magnitude
	AND Magnitude >= 7.5
___ ___ Magnitude DESC;







/*
Returns earthquakes in New Zealand with a magnitude of 7.5 or more
*/

SELECT Date, Place, NearestPop, Magnitude
FROM Earthquakes
WHERE Country = 'NZ'
	AND Magnitude >= 7.5
ORDER BY Magnitude DESC;


Date	Place	NearestPop	Magnitude
13-Nov-16	54km NNE of Amberley - New Zealand	Culverden	7.8
15-Jul-09	off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand	Manapouri	7.8
25-May-81	off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand	Tuatapere	7.6
12-Sep-64	off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand	Tuatapere	7.6
1-Sep-45	off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand	Tuatapere	7.5
Showing 5 out of 5 rows


The order of the SQL syntax in the query may not be the same as how you think about the query.

Check the results of the query, if you know your geography, there have been some big earthquakes in the South Island of New Zealand.
