Uncorrelated subquery
A sub-query is another query within a query. The sub-query returns its results to an outer query to be processed.
You want a query that returns the region and countries that have experienced earthquakes centered at a depth of 400km or deeper. Your query will use the Earthquakes table in the sub-query, and Nations table in the outer query.

Why is the query from Step 1 an example of an uncorrelated sub-query?
The sub-query cannot be run independently of the outer query.
The outer query is referenced in the sub-query.
The sub-query is used as a WHERE filter condition for the outer query. Only uncorrelated sub-queries can be used like this.

#YES - The sub-query does not reference the outer query.
Great! In uncorrelated sub-queries, the sub-query does not reference the outer query and therefore can run independently of the outer query.
