IN, EXISTS
You want to know which, if any, country capitals are listed as the nearest city to recorded earthquakes. You can get this information using INTERSECT and comparing the Nations table with the Earthquakes table. However, INTERSECT requires that the number and order of columns in the SELECT statements must be the same between queries and you would like to include additional columns from the outer query in the results.
You attempt two queries, each with a different operator that gives you the results you require.


Add the 2017 country population and capital city name columns to the outer query.
Add the operator to compare the outer query with the sub-query.
-- First attempt
SELECT CountryName,
       Pop2017, -- 2017 country population
	   Capital, -- Capital city	   
       WorldBankRegion
FROM Nations
WHERE Capital IN -- Add the operator to compare queries
        (SELECT NearestPop 
	     FROM Earthquakes);



CountryName	Pop2017	Capital	WorldBankRegion
Tonga	108020	Nuku alofa	East Asia and Pacific
French Southern Territories	145	Saint-Pierre	Europe and Central Asia
Turkmenistan	5758075	Ashgabat	Europe and Central Asia
Northern Mariana Islands	55144	Saipan	East Asia and Pacific

Puerto Rico	3663131	San Juan	Latin America and Carribean

Update the query with the 2016 population instead of the 2017 population.
Add the operator to compare the outer query with the sub-query.
Add the two city name columns, being compared, in the sub-query.

-- Second attempt
SELECT CountryName,   
	   Capital,
       Pop2016, -- 2016 country population
       WorldBankRegion
FROM Nations AS n
WHERE EXISTS -- Add the operator to compare queries
	  (SELECT 1
	   FROM Earthquakes AS e
	   WHERE n.Capital = e.NearestPop); -- Columns being compared

Excellent! IN and EXISTS are the appropriate operators to use here. Their advantage over INTERSECT is that the results can contain any column from the outer query in any order, the population column appears after the capital city column now.
