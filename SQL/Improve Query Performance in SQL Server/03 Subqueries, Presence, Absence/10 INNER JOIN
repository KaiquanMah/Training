INNER JOIN
An insurance company that specializes in sports franchises has asked you to assess the geological hazards of cities hosting NBA teams. You believe you can get this information by querying the Teams and Earthquakes tables across the Earthquakes and NBA Season 2017-2018 databases respectively. Your initial query will use EXISTS to compare tables. The second query will use a more appropriate operator.

Add the table for the outer query.
Add the operator to compare the outer query with the sub-query.
Add the table for the sub-query.
Check the results. Only columns from the Teams table are returned.

-- Initial query
SELECT TeamName,
       TeamCode,
	   City
FROM Teams AS t -- Add table
WHERE EXISTS -- Operator to compare queries
      (SELECT 1 
	  FROM Earthquakes AS e -- Add table
	  WHERE t.City = e.NearestPop);


TeamName	TeamCode	City
San Antonio Spurs	SAS	San Antonio
Showing 1 out of 1 rows








Something doesn't look right. You'll need columns from the Earthquakes and Teams tables to makes sense of the results.
Add the place description and country code where the earthquake occurred.
Add the operator to compare the tables.

-- Second query
SELECT t.TeamName,
       t.TeamCode,
	   t.City,
	   e.Date,
	   e.place, -- Place description
	   e.Country -- Country code
FROM Teams AS t
INNER JOIN Earthquakes AS e -- Operator to compare tables
	  ON t.City = e.NearestPop


TeamName	TeamCode	City	Date	place	Country
San Antonio Spurs	SAS	San Antonio	9-Apr-85	Libertador General Bernardo OHiggins - Chile	CL
San Antonio Spurs	SAS	San Antonio	18-Mar-31	Valparaiso - Chile	CL
Showing 2 out of 2 rows










In this exercise, what does the INNER JOIN help you to determine that EXISTS could not?

Queries that use EXISTS are slower than queries that use INNER JOIN.
The INNER JOIN returned two rows, so there must be duplicate rows in the Teams table.
The NBA team based in San Antonio, USA has a high risk of earthquake hazards.

#YES - The earthquakes occurred in San Antonio, Chile, not San Antonio, USA.
Awesome! The two earthquakes returned in the second query occurred in San Antonio, Chile, nowhere near the home of the San Antonio Spurs. We were able to determine this because results from an INNER JOIN can contain any column, from all joined queries.
An insurance company would probably use a more comprehensive spatial database for this type of assessment instead of our simple databases used in this course.
