The Venn diagram below describes which method used to check whether the data in one table is present, or absent, in a related table?
#left query - green
#intersection - blank/hollow
#right query - grey


The Earthquakes database is available for you to test scenarios in the query console.
EXISTS
inclusive LEFT OUTER JOIN
INTERSECT

#YES - exclusive LEFT OUTER JOIN
Good job! An exclusive LEFT OUTER JOIN checks for data in one table that is absent in a related table. It does this by using IS NULL in a WHERE filter condition of the right query to restrict it to rows that do not match in the left query.
