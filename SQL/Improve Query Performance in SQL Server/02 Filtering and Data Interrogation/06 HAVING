When filtering a numeric column, HAVING must be used with an aggregate function, for example: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()...
WHERE and HAVING can be used in the same query.
Use HAVING with, and after, GROUP BY.

#YES - HAVING and WHERE produce the same output, so it doesn't matter which one you use.
Great! This statement is FALSE. WHERE and HAVING are NOT used to do the same thing. Although WHERE and HAVING can sometimes produce the same results WHERE should only be used for filtering individual or ungrouped rows and HAVING for filtering grouped rows.
