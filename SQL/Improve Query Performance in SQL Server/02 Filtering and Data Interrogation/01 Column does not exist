Column does not exist
When using WHERE as a filter condition, it is important to think about the processing order in the query. In this exercise, you want a query that returns NBA players with average total rebounds of 12 or more per game. The following formula calculates average total rebounds from the PlayerStats table;
AverageTotalRebounds = (DefensiveRebounds+OffensiveRebounds)/GamesPlayed

The first query in Step 1 returns an error. Select Run Code to view the error. The second query, in Step 2, will give you the results you want, without error, by using a sub-query.
Note that GamesPlayed is CAST AS numeric to ensure we get decimal points in our output, as opposed to whole numbers.



Try to understand what the error is telling you when you run the first query, then comment out the query block on lines 2 and 9.
-- First query

SELECT PlayerName, 
    Team, 
    Position,
    (DRebound+ORebound)/CAST(GamesPlayed AS numeric) AS AvgRebounds
FROM PlayerStats
WHERE AvgRebounds >= 12;

('42S22', "[42S22] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Invalid column name 'AvgRebounds'. (207) (SQLExecDirectW)")



-- First query

    Position,

In the sub-query calculate average total rebounds in a new column, AvgRebounds.
Add the new column to the SELECT statement.
Apply a filter condition for 12 or more average total rebounds.

-- Second query

-- Add the new column to the select statement
SELECT PlayerName, 
       Team, 
       Position, 
       AvgRebounds -- Add the new column
FROM
     -- Sub-query starts here

      PlayerName,

      -- Calculate average total rebounds
     (DRebound+ORebound)/CAST(GamesPlayed AS numeric) AS AvgRebounds
	 FROM PlayerStats) tr
WHERE AvgRebounds >= 12; -- Filter rows

Nice work! A column specified in the SELECT statement must exist before a WHERE filter condition can be applied to it, in this case, AvgRebounds. You created this column in a sub-query which made it available for filtering with WHERE in the outer query.

Looking at the results, it looks like Centers (Position = C) are the kings of rebounds.
