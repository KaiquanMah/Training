UNION or DISTINCT()?
When deciding whether to use DISTINCT() or UNION in a query to remove duplicate rows, which of the following questions would you NOT ask yourself?


Is there an alternative method to using DISTINCT()?
Will appending queries produce duplicate rows?
Is there an aggregate function in the SELECT statement?

#YES - Should I be thinking about duplicate rows because my queries never produce duplicate rows?
Good job! Even queries you think that are good may return unwanted duplicate rows. Before starting a project in SQL make sure you have a good understanding of what the database contains and ensure you perform a thorough interrogation of the data sets you will be using.
