Filtering with WHERE and HAVING
WHERE and HAVING can be used as filters in the same query. But how we use them, where we use them and what we use them for is quite different.
You want a query that returns the total points contribution of a teams Power Forwards where their total points contribution is greater than 3000.

Apply a filter condition for only rows where position equals Power Forward (PF).
Apply a grouped row filter for total points greater than 3000.
SELECT Team, 
	SUM(TotalPoints) AS TotalPFPoints
FROM PlayerStats
-- Filter for only rows with power forwards
WHERE Position = 'PF'
GROUP BY Team
-- Filter for total points greater than 3000
HAVING SUM(TotalPoints) > 3000;


Team	TotalPFPoints
CLE	3097
Showing 1 out of 1 rows

Good job! WHERE is used as a filter condition on individual rows, in this case, Position = 'PF', and HAVING is used as a numeric filter condition on grouped rows and must be used with an aggregate function, in this case, SUM(TotalPoints) >3000.

Looking at the results, Cleveland Cavaliers must've had some good Power Forwards that season.
