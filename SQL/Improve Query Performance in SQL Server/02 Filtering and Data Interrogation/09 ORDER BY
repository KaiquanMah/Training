Should I use ORDER BY?
Which of the following statements is FALSE, when considering using ORDER BY in a query?

ORDER BY is processed after SELECT.
ORDER BY is useful for data interrogation and unless there is a good reason to sort the data in a query, try to avoid using it.
ORDER BY can be used in conjunction with the TOP operator.

#YES - ORDER BY is only supported by Microsoft SQL Server and none of the other major database vendors.
Great! This statement is FALSE. ORDER BY is supported by the major database vendors. Using TOP to restrict rows for data interrogation is only supported in Microsoft SQL Server.
