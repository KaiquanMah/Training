Functions in WHERE
You want to know which players from the 2017-2018 NBA season went to college in Louisiana. You ask a friend to make the query for you. It looks like he overcomplicated the WHERE filter condition by unnecessarily applying string functions and, also, it does not give you precisely what you want because he forgot how to spell Louisiana. You will simplify his query to return exactly what you require.

Select Run Code to see what your friend's query returns.
Think about why his query is not giving you exactly what you require then comment out his filter on line 7.

Excellent! Often there may be a simpler way to write a WHERE condition that avoids the use of a function on a column, in this case by using a simple wildcard filter.

Your friends' wildcard filter returns all colleges beginning with Lou (regardless of case) which includes some not in Louisiana. Louisville is in Kentucky!.
