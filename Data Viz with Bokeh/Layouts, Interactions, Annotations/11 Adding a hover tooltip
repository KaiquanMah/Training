# Working with the HoverTool is easy for data stored in a ColumnDataSource.
# In this exercise, you will create a HoverTool object and display the country for each circle glyph in the figure that you created in the last exercise. This is done by assigning the tooltips keyword argument to a list-of-tuples specifying the label and the column of values from the ColumnDataSource using the @ operator.
# The figure object has been prepared for you as p.
# After you have added the hover tooltip to the figure, be sure to interact with it by hovering your mouse over each point to see which country it represents.



# Import HoverTool from bokeh.models
from bokeh.models import HoverTool

# Create a HoverTool object: hover
hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[('Country','@Country')])

# Add the HoverTool object to figure p
p.add_tools(hover)

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('hover.html')
show(p)
