# Layouts are collections of Bokeh figure objects.
# In this exercise, you're going to create two plots from the Literacy and Birth Rate data set to plot fertility vs female literacy and population vs female literacy.
# By using the row() method, you'll create a single layout of the two figures.
# Remember, as in the previous chapter, once you have created your figures, you can interact with them in various ways.
# In this exercise, you may have to scroll sideways to view both figures in the row layout. Alternatively, you can view the figures in a new window by clicking on the expand icon to the right of the "Bokeh plot" tab.



# Import row from bokeh.layouts
from bokeh.layouts import row

# Create the first figure: p1
p1 = figure(x_axis_label='fertility (children per woman)', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add a circle glyph to p1
p1.circle('fertility', 'female_literacy', source=source)

# Create the second figure: p2
p2 = figure(x_axis_label='population', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add a circle glyph to p2
p2.circle('population', 'female_literacy', source=source)

# Put p1 and p2 into a horizontal row: layout
layout = row(p1,p2)

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('fert_row.html')
show(layout)
