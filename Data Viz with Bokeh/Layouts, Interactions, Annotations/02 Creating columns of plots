# In this exercise, you're going to use the column() function to create a single column layout of the two plots you created in the previous exercise.
# Figure p1 has been created for you.
# In this exercise and the ones to follow, you may have to scroll down to view the lower portion of the figure.



# Import column from the bokeh.layouts module
from bokeh.layouts import column

# Create a blank figure: p1
p1 = figure(x_axis_label='fertility (children per woman)', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add circle scatter to the figure p1
p1.circle('fertility', 'female_literacy', source=source)

#HOW IS THIS EVEN A BLANK FIGURE?!?!
# Create a new blank figure: p2
p2 = figure(x_axis_label='population', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add circle scatter to the figure p2
p2.circle('population', 'female_literacy', source=source)

# Put plots p1 and p2 in a column: layout
layout=column(p1,p2)

# Specify the name of the output_file and show the result
output_file('fert_column.html')
show(layout)
