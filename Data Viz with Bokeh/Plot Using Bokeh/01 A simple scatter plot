# In this example, you're going to make a scatter plot of female literacy vs fertility using data from the European Environmental Agency. This dataset highlights that countries with low female literacy have high birthrates. The x-axis data has been loaded for you as fertility and the y-axis data has been loaded as female_literacy.
#http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/correlation-between-fertility-and-female-education
# Your job is to create a figure, assign x-axis and y-axis labels, and plot female_literacy vs fertility using the circle glyph.
# After you have created the figure, in this exercise and the ones to follow, play around with it! Explore the different options available to you on the tab to the right, such as "Pan", "Box Zoom", and "Wheel Zoom". You can click on the question mark sign for more details on any of these tools.

# Import figure from bokeh.plotting
from bokeh.plotting import figure

# Import output_file and show from bokeh.io
from bokeh.io import output_file, show

# Create the figure: p
p = figure(x_axis_label='fertility (children per woman)', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add a circle glyph to the figure p
#Add a circle glyph to the figure p using the function p.circle() where the inputs are, in order, the x-axis data and y-axis data.
p.circle(fertility, female_literacy)

# Call the output_file() function and specify the name of the file
#Use the output_file() function to specify the name 'fert_lit.html' for the output file.
output_file('fert_lit.html')

# Display the plot
show(p)
