# The final glyph customization we'll practice is using the CategoricalColorMapper to color each glyph by a categorical property.
# Here, you're going to use the automobile dataset to plot miles-per-gallon vs weight and color each circle glyph by the region where the automobile was manufactured.
# The origin column will be used in the ColorMapper to color automobiles manufactured in the US as blue, Europe as red and Asia as green.
# The automobile data set is provided to you as a Pandas DataFrame called df. The figure is provided for you as p.



#Import CategoricalColorMapper from bokeh.models
from bokeh.models import CategoricalColorMapper

# Convert df to a ColumnDataSource: source
source = ColumnDataSource(df)

# Make a CategoricalColorMapper object: color_mapper
color_mapper = CategoricalColorMapper(factors=['Europe', 'Asia', 'US'],
                                      palette=['red', 'green', 'blue'])

# Add a circle glyph to the figure p
p.circle('weight', 'mpg', source=source,
            color=dict(field='origin', transform=color_mapper),
            legend='origin')

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('colormap.html')
show(p)
