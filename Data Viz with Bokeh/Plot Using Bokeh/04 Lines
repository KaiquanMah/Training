# We can draw lines on Bokeh plots with the line() glyph function.
# In this exercise, you'll plot the daily adjusted closing price of Apple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) from 2000 to 2013.
# The data points are provided for you as lists. date is a list of datetime objects to plot on the x-axis and price is a list of prices to plot on the y-axis.
# Since we are plotting dates on the x-axis, you must add x_axis_type='datetime' when creating the figure object.
# https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html


# Import figure from bokeh.plotting
from bokeh.plotting import figure

# Create a figure with x_axis_type="datetime": p
p = figure(x_axis_type='datetime', x_axis_label='Date', y_axis_label='US Dollars')

# Plot date along the x axis and price along the y axis
p.line(date,price)

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('line.html')
show(p)
