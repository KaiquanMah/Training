# The three most important arguments to customize scatter glyphs are color, size, and alpha. Bokeh accepts colors as hexadecimal strings, tuples of RGB values between 0 and 255, and any of the 147 CSS color names. Size values are supplied in screen space units with 100 meaning the size of the entire figure.
# The alpha parameter controls transparency. It takes in floating point numbers between 0.0, meaning completely transparent, and 1.0, meaning completely opaque.
# In this exercise, you'll plot female literacy vs fertility for Africa and Latin America as red and blue circle glyphs, respectively.

# Create the figure: p
p = figure(x_axis_label='fertility (children per woman)', y_axis_label='female_literacy (% population)')

# Add a blue circle glyph to the figure p
p.circle(fertility_latinamerica, female_literacy_latinamerica, color='blue', size=10, alpha=0.8)

# Add a red circle glyph to the figure p
p.circle(fertility_africa, female_literacy_africa, color='red', size=10, alpha=0.8)

# Specify the name of the file
output_file('fert_lit_separate_colors.html')

# Display the plot
show(p)
