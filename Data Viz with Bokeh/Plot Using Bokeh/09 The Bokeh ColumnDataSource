# You can create a ColumnDataSource object directly from a Pandas DataFrame by passing the DataFrame to the class initializer.
# In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and read in a data set containing all Olympic medals awarded in the 100 meter sprint from 1896 to 2012. A color column has been added indicating the CSS colorname we wish to use in the plot for every data point.
# Your job is to import the ColumnDataSource class, create a new ColumnDataSource object from the DataFrame df, and plot circle glyphs with 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Time' on the y-axis. Color each glyph by the color column.
# The figure object p has already been created for you.


# Import the ColumnDataSource class from bokeh.plotting
from bokeh.plotting import ColumnDataSource

# Create a ColumnDataSource from df: source
#Use the ColumnDataSource() function to make a new ColumnDataSource object called source from the DataFrame df.
source = ColumnDataSource(df)

# Add circle glyphs to the figure p
#Use p.circle() to plot circle glyphs of size=8 on the figure p with 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Time' on the y-axis. Be sure to also specify source=source and color='color' so that the ColumnDataSource object is used and each glyph is colored by the color column.
#source=ColumnDataSource helps you to specify the df you are selecting from
#then selecting the x and y cols
#select color from the color col
p.circle(x='Year',y='Time',source=source, color='color',size=8)

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('sprint.html')
show(p)
