# In Bokeh, extended geometrical shapes can be plotted by using the patches() glyph function. The patches glyph takes as input a list-of-lists collection of numeric values specifying the vertices in x and y directions of each distinct patch to plot.
# In this exercise, you will plot the state borders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The latitude and longitude vertices for each state have been prepared as lists.
# Your job is to plot longitude on the x-axis and latitude on the y-axis. The figure object has been created for you as p.



# Create a list of az_lons, co_lons, nm_lons and ut_lons: x
x = [az_lons, co_lons, nm_lons, ut_lons]

# Create a list of az_lats, co_lats, nm_lats and ut_lats: y
y = [az_lats, co_lats, nm_lats, ut_lats]

# Add patches to figure p with line_color=white for x and y
#Use p.patches() to add the patches glyph to the figure p. Supply the x and y lists as arguments along with a line_color of 'white'.
p.patches(x,y,line_color='white')

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('four_corners.html')
show(p)
