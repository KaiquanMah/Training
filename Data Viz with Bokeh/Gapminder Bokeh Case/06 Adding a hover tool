# In this exercise, you'll practice adding a hover tool to drill down into data column values and display more detailed information about each scatter point.
# After you're done, experiment with the hover tool and see how it displays the name of the country when your mouse hovers over a point!
# The figure and slider have been created for you and are available in the workspace as plot and slider.



# Import HoverTool from bokeh.models
from bokeh.models import HoverTool

# Create a HoverTool: hover
hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[('Country', '@country')])

# Add the HoverTool to the plot
plot.add_tools(hover)

# Create layout: layout
layout = row(widgetbox(slider), plot)

# Add layout to current document
curdoc().add_root(layout)
