# We've seen that pandas supports method chaining. This technique can be very powerful when cleaning and filtering data.
# In this exercise, a DataFrame containing flight departure data for a single airline and a single airport for the month of July 2015 has been pre-loaded. Your job is to use .str() filtering and method chaining to generate summary statistics on flight delays each day to Dallas.


# Strip extra whitespace from the column names: df.columns
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()

# Extract data for which the destination airport is Dallas: dallas
dallas = df['Destination Airport'].str.contains('DAL')

# Compute the total number of Dallas departures each day: daily_departures
daily_departures = dallas.resample('D').sum()

# Generate the summary statistics for daily Dallas departures: stats
stats = daily_departures.describe()
