# In this exercise, some hourly weather data is pre-loaded for you. You will continue to practice resampling, this time using rolling means.
# Rolling means (or moving averages) are generally used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in time series data and highlight long-term trends. You can read more about them here.
# To use the .rolling() method, you must always use method chaining, first calling .rolling() and then chaining an aggregation method after it. For example, with a Series hourly_data, hourly_data.rolling(window=24).mean() would compute new values for each hourly point, based on a 24-hour window stretching out behind each point. The frequency of the output data is the same: it is still hourly. Such an operation is useful for smoothing time series data.
# Your job is to resample the data using the combination of .rolling() and .mean(). You will work with the same DataFrame df from the previous exercise.



# Extract data from 2010-Aug-01 to 2010-Aug-15: unsmoothed
unsmoothed = df['Temperature']['2010-08-01':'2010-08-15']

# Apply a rolling mean with a 24 hour window: smoothed
smoothed = unsmoothed.rolling(window=24).mean()

# Create a new DataFrame with columns smoothed and unsmoothed: august
august = pd.DataFrame({'smoothed':smoothed, 'unsmoothed':unsmoothed})

# Plot both smoothed and unsmoothed data using august.plot().
august.plot()
plt.show()
