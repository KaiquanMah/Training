# In previous exercises, we have preloaded the data for you using the pandas function read_csv(). Now, it's your turn! Your job is to read the World Bank population data you saw earlier into a DataFrame using read_csv(). The file is available in the variable data_file.
# The next step is to reread the same file, but simultaneously rename the columns using the names keyword input parameter, set equal to a list of new column labels. You will also need to set header=0 to rename the column labels.
# Finish up by inspecting the result with df.head() and df.info() in the IPython Shell (changing df to the name of your DataFrame variable).
# pandas has already been imported and is available in the workspace as pd.

# Read in the file: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(data_file)

# Create a list of the new column labels: new_labels
new_labels = ['year', 'population']

# Read in the file, specifying the header and names parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(data_file, header=0, names=new_labels)

# Print both the DataFrames
print(df1)
print(df2)
