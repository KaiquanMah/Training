# Not all data files are clean and tidy. Pandas provides methods for reading those not-so-perfect data files that you encounter far too often.
# In this exercise, you have monthly stock data for four companies downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The data is stored as one row for each company and each column is the end-of-month closing price. The file name is given to you in the variable file_messy.
# In addition, this file has three aspects that may cause trouble for lesser tools: multiple header lines, comment records (rows) interleaved throughout the data rows, and space delimiters instead of commas.
# Your job is to use pandas to read the data from this problematic file_messy using non-default input options with read_csv() so as to tidy up the mess at read time. Then, write the cleaned up data to a CSV file with the variable file_clean that has been prepared for you, as you might do in a real data workflow.
# You can learn about the option input parameters needed by using help() on the pandas function pd.read_csv().



# Read the raw file as-is: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(file_messy)

# Print the output of df1.head()
print(df1.head())

# Read in the file with the correct parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(file_messy, delimiter=' ', header=3, comment='#')

# Print the output of df2.head()
print(df2.head())

# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to a CSV file without the index
df2.to_csv(file_clean, index=False)

# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to an excel file without the index
df2.to_excel('file_clean.xlsx', index=False)
