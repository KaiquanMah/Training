# You can implicitly use 'broadcasting', a feature of NumPy, when creating pandas DataFrames. In this exercise, you're going to create a DataFrame of cities in Pennsylvania that contains the city name in one column and the state name in the second. We have imported the names of 15 cities as the list cities.
# Your job is to construct a DataFrame from the list of cities and the string 'PA'.


# Make a string with the value 'PA': state
state = 'PA'

# Construct a dictionary: data
data = {'state':state, 'city':cities}

# Construct a DataFrame from dictionary data: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
