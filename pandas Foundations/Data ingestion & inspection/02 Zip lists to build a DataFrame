# In this exercise, you're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from Wikipedia.
# Your job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, you'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd.
# Note: The zip() function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list(). You can learn more about the zip() function as well as generators in Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2).


# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys,list_values))

# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)

# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)

# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
