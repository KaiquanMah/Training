# In order to use the full power of pandas time series, you must construct a DatetimeIndex. To do so, it is necessary to clean and transform the date and time columns.
# The DataFrame df_dropped you created in the last exercise is provided for you and pandas has been imported as pd.
# Your job is to clean up the date and Time columns and combine them into a datetime collection to be used as the Index.




# Convert the date column to string: df_dropped['date']
df_dropped['date'] = df_dropped['date'].astype(str)

# Pad leading zeros to the Time column: df_dropped['Time']
df_dropped['Time'] = df_dropped['Time'].apply(lambda x:'{:0>4}'.format(x))

# Concatenate the new date and Time columns: date_string
date_string = df_dropped['date']+df_dropped['Time']

# Convert the date_string Series to datetime: date_times
date_times = pd.to_datetime(date_string, format='%Y%m%d%H%M')

# Set the index to be the new date_times container: df_clean
df_clean = df_dropped.set_index(date_times)

# Print the output of df_clean.head()
print(df_clean.head())
