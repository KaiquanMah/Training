# Now that you have the data read and cleaned, you can begin with statistical EDA. First, you will analyze the 2011 Austin weather data.
# Your job in this exercise is to analyze the 'dry_bulb_faren' column and print the median temperatures for specific time ranges. You can do this using partial datetime string selection.
# The cleaned dataframe is provided in the workspace as df_clean.


# Print the median of the dry_bulb_faren column
print(df_clean['dry_bulb_faren'].median())

# Print the median of the dry_bulb_faren column for the time range '2011-Apr':'2011-Jun'
print(df_clean.loc['2011-Apr':'2011-Jun', 'dry_bulb_faren'].median())

# Print the median of the dry_bulb_faren column for the month of January
print(df_clean.loc['2011-01', 'dry_bulb_faren'].median())
