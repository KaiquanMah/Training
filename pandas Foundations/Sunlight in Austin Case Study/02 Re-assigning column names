# After the initial step of reading in the data, the next step is to clean and tidy it so that it is easier to work with.
# In this exercise, you will begin this cleaning process by re-assigning column names and dropping unnecessary columns.
# pandas has been imported in the workspace as pd, and the file NOAA_QCLCD_2011_hourly_13904.txt has been parsed and loaded into a DataFrame df. The comma separated string of column names, column_labels, and list of columns to drop, list_to_drop, have also been loaded for you.



# Split on the comma to create a list: column_labels_list
column_labels_list = column_labels.split(',')
# str == type(column_labels)
# list == type(column_labels_list)

# Assign the new column labels to the DataFrame: df.columns
df.columns = column_labels_list

# Remove the appropriate columns: df_dropped
df_dropped = df.drop(list_to_drop, axis='columns')

# Print the output of df_dropped.head()
print(df_dropped.head())
