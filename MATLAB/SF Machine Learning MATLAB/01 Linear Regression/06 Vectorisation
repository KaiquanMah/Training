%unvectorised implementation

%MATLAB is 1-indexed, i.e. index starts from 1
%unlike in CS, python where indexes tend to start from 0
%so we update from 0:n to 1:n+1
for j = 1:n+1,

  prediction = prediction + theta(j) * x(j);

end;



%vectorised implementation
%using numerical linear algebra routines/libraries
prediction = theta' * x;


%such that
theta=[theta1; theta2; theta3]
x=[x1; x2; x3]
