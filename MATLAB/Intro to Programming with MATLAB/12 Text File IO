        % give me the final k as charnum
        charnum = k;
        
    % if file is not found / character is not valid, charnum = -1
    else

Code to call your function
type('simple.txt')
charnum = char_counter('simple.txt','a')
charnum = char_counter('Frankenstein-by-Shelley.txt','?')



Output
This file should have exactly three a-s...
charnum =
     3

charnum =
   220
