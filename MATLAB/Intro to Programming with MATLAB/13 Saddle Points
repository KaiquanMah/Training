Saddle Points

Function
function indices = saddle(M)

% instantiate the Matrix saddle_m with 0s
saddle_m =  zeros(size(M));

% If dim = 1, then max(A,[],1) returns a row vector containing the largest element in each column.
% If dim = 2, then max(A,[],2) returns a column vector containing the largest element in each row.
% we want the max for each row, and min for each col
row_maxima = max(M, [], 2);
col_minima = min(M, [], 1);

% instantiate the list of indices
indices = [];
    
    % iterate along each row
    for i = 1:size(M, 1)
        
        % iterate along each col
        for j = 1:size(M, 2)
            
            % saddle point is an element whose value is >= every element in its row AND <= every element in its col
            % there may be more than 1 saddle pt
            % evaluate across each M(i, j) element whether they are saddle pts
            if M(i, j) == row_maxima(i) && M(i, j) == col_minima(j)
                
                % set value = 1 in Matrix saddle_m for each saddle pt
                saddle_m(i, j) = 1;
                indices = [i, j; indices];
                
            end
            
        end
        
    end
    
end










Code to call your function
% create an interesting surface
[X,Y] = meshgrid(-15:0.5:10,-10:0.5:10);
Z = (X.^2-Y.^2)';

% find saddle points
indices = saddle(Z)

% plot surface
surf(Z);
hold on

% mark saddle points with red dots in the same figure
for ii = 1:size(indices,1)
    h = scatter3(indices(ii,2),indices(ii,1),Z(indices(ii,1),indices(ii,2)),'red','filled');
    h.SizeData = 120;
end

% adjust viewpoint
view(-115,14);
hold off









Output
indices =
    31    21
