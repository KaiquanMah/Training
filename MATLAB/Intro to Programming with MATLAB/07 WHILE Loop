Find the next prime number
Function
function k = next_prime(n)

% instantiate k = 0
k=0;

    % while 'k' is not prime
    while isprime(k)==0
    
         % give me the next integer and set it as 'n'
         % set 'k' as the latest 'n'
         n=n+1;
         k=n;
    
    % the while loop ends/terminates when 'k' is finally a prime number
    % and we get the prime number 'n' or 'k' as our final output
    end

end








Code to call your function
k = next_prime(2)





Output
k =
     3
