Decision Branching
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Do not edit. This code creates a random number to test the if statement.
doPlot = randi([0 1])

This code loads the data.
load datafile
density = data(:,1);

>> doPlot
doPlot =
     1







The body of an if block is only executed if the condition is true.
Use == to check for equality.
if x == 0.5
    y = 3
end
TASK1
Modify the script so that the plotting code on lines 4-7 are executed only when doPlot is 1.






Often in these situations, you may want to execute some other code if the condition is not met. To do this, you can use the else keyword, as shown.
x = rand
if x > 0.5
    y = 3
else
    y = 4
end
TASK2
Modify the script so that when the if condition is not satisfied, the following line of code is executed:
disp("The density of " + element ...
    + " is " + density)






Task 1 & 2
if doPlot == 1,
    
    plot(density)
    title("Sample Densities")
    xticklabels(element)
    ylabel("Density (g/cm^3)")

else    

    disp("The density of " + element + " is " + density)
    
end






>> data

data =

    0.5300    4.0753       NaN
    1.7800    6.6678    2.1328
    0.8600    1.5177    3.6852
    1.6000    3.6375    8.5389
    3.0000    4.7243   10.1570
    6.1100    9.0698    2.8739
    2.5400    5.3002    4.4508

>> density

density =

    0.5300
    1.7800
    0.8600
    1.6000
    3.0000
    6.1100
    2.5400

>> element

element = 

  7Ã—1 string array

    "Lithium"
    "Argon"
    "Potassium"
    "Calcium"
    "Scandium"
    "Vanadium"
    "Strontium"














The elseif keyword can be used after if to add more conditions. You can include multiple elseif blocks.
Try adding a variable doDisplay to toggle if the densities are displayed. Add this condition with an elseif block.
% not sure what this further exercise actually wants

















Further Practice
doPlot = 0

if doPlot == 1,
    
    plot(density)
    title("Sample Densities")
    xticklabels(element)
    ylabel("Density (g/cm^3)")

else    

    disp("The density of " + element + " is " + density)
    
end



>> doPlot
doPlot =
     0

    "The density of Lithium is 0.53"
    "The density of Argon is 1.78"
    "The density of Potassium is 0.86"
    "The density of Calcium is 1.6"
    "The density of Scandium is 3"
    "The density of Vanadium is 6.11"
    "The density of Strontium is 2.54"
