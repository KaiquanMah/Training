Working with Tables
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

To extract a variable from the table, you can use dot notation:
data.VariableName
TASK
Assign the contents of elements.Density to a column vector named d.

Task 1
d = elements.Density

>> d
d =
    0.5300
    1.7800
    0.8600
    1.6000
    3.0000
    6.1100
    2.5400













If you are working with a table, you might want to keep related data together. Instead of creating separate variables, you can assign the result of a calculation to a table.
data.HeightMeters = data.HeightYards*0.9144
If the variable data.HeightMeters doesn't exist, MATLAB will create a new variable in the table with the name HeightMeters.
TASK2
Multiply each element of elements.Density with elements.Volume1. Remember to use elementwise multiplication with .*.
Assign the result to elements.Mass.

Task 2 & 3
elements.Mass = elements.Density .* elements.Volume1
% ascending order
elements = sortrows(elements,'Mass')
% descending order
% elements = sortrows(elements,'Mass','descend')





You can interact with a table by clicking on it in the output pane of a live script. For example, you can sort a table using one of its variables.
Once you are happy with your table, you can make the changes permanent by updating the code in your script.
The generated code uses single quotes. In this case, single quotes and double quotes can be used interchangeably.
"Single quotes create a character vector and double quotes create a string. In most cases, strings are preferable."
TASK3
Sort the table by smallest to largest mass. Then update the code in the script before clicking Submit.

Dot notation is used to extract table variables. To extract rows, you can use regular array indexing.
Try extracting the first three rows of the table:
top3 = elements(1:3,:)
Notice that top3 is also a table.

Further Practice
top3 = elements(1:3,:)



>> top3

top3 =

  3×5 table

      Element      Density    Volume1    Volume2     Mass

    "Potassium"     0.86      1.5177     3.6852     1.3052
    "Lithium"       0.53      4.0753        NaN     2.1599
    "Calcium"        1.6      3.6375     8.5389       5.82
