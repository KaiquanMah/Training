What's an Array?
All MATLAB variables are arrays. This means that each numeric variable can contain multiple numbers. You can use arrays to store related data in one variable.
Because you'll use arrays every time you program, it's important to get to know them and the terminology used to describe them.







A single number, called a scalar, is actually a 1-by-1 array, meaning it contains 1 row and 1 column.
TASK
Create a variable named x with a value of 4.

Task 1
x=4




You can create arrays with multiple elements using square brackets.
x = [3 5]
x = 
    3    5
TASK
Create an array named x with two elements: 7 and 9

Task 2
x = [7 9]






When you separate numbers by spaces (or commas) as shown in the previous task, MATLAB combines the numbers into a COLUMN vector, 
which is an array with one COLUMN and multiple ROWS (n-by-1). 
When you separate numbers by semicolons, MATLAB creates a column vector (n-by-1).
x = [1;3]
x = 
    1
    3
TASK
Create an array named x with two elements, 7 and 9, in a single column.
Try copying the previous command and changing the space between the numbers to a semicolon (;).

Task 3
x = [7; 9]







TASK
Create a row vector named x that contains the values 3, 10, and 5 in that order.

Task 4
x = [3 10 5]






TASK
Create a column vector named x that contains the values 8, 2, and -4 in that order.

Task 5
x = [8; 2; -4]









You can combine spaces and semicolons to create a matrix, which is an array with multiple rows and columns. When entering a matrix, you must enter them row by row.
x = [3 4 5;6 7 8]
x = 
    3    4    5
    6    7    8
    
TASK
Create a matrix named x with the values shown below.
5    6    7
8    9   10

Task 6
x = [5    6    7; 8    9   10]








In MATLAB, you can perform calculations within the square brackets.
x = [abs(-4) 4^2]
x = 
     4    16
     
TASK
Create a row vector named x that contains sqrt(10) as its first element and pi^2 (π^2) as its second element.

Task 7
x = [sqrt(10) pi^2]









Arrays are used throughout MATLAB. In fact, MATLAB is an abbreviation for MATrix LABoratory. You'll find that most MATLAB functionality can work on multiple values at once.

There is some flexibility when you create arrays. For example, these are all valid ways to create the same array:
x = [7 9]
x=[7,9]
x = [7, 9]

Try experimenting with whitespace, commas, and semicolons when creating this matrix:
7 1 8
4 5 8
10 4 2


Further Practice
x = [7 1 8; 4,5,8; 10, 4, 2]

>> x
x =
     7     1     8
     4     5     8
    10     4     2
