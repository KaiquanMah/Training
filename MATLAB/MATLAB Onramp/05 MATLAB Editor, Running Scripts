You can enter commands in a script by clicking on the gray code box.
When you're ready, you can submit your code by clicking the blue Submit button.

TASK
Enter the command r = 3 in the script.

TASK
Add the command x = pi*r^2 to the script.

r=3
x = pi*r^2









When you complete tasks in the Live Editor, the Command Window and Workspace are minimized.
You can still access them by clicking on their name.
Try viewing the variables x and r in the Workspace by clicking Workspace on the right.

















This live script contains formatted text, code, and section breaks. In this course, scripts will include Task headers to show where you should enter your code.
You can test your code before submitting by running the script. To execute the entire script, click the Run button.

TASK
Run the script to populate the output pane.
Then modify the command for Task 1 so that r has a value of 0.5.



Running Scripts
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1
r = 0.5
This code sets up the interaction.
x = pi*r^2






To execute the code for just one section, you can click the Run Section button in the MATLAB Toolstrip.
Try changing the value of r and running only that section. What happens to the value of r in the output pane? What about the value of x?
You can also use the buttons in the Toolstrip to switch between text and code.
Try adding the text "Calculate circumference." Add a new code block after the text that contains y = 2*pi*r.

Calculate circumference
y = 2*pi*r
