Plotting Vectors
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

This code creates data for the interaction.
load datafile
sample = data(:,1);
density = data(:,2);
v1 = data(:,3);
v2 = data(:,4);
mass1 = density.*v1;
mass2 = density.*v2;

This code creates the plot from the last activity.
plot(sample,mass1,"ks")
hold on
plot(sample,mass2,"r*")
hold off








Labels can be added to plots using plot annotation functions, such as title. The input to these functions is a string. Strings in MATLAB are enclosed in double quotes (").
title("Plot Title")
TASK
Add the title "Sample Mass" to the existing plot.

Task 1
title("Sample Mass")





TASK
Use the ylabel function to add the label "Mass (g)".

Task 2
ylabel("Mass (g)")








You can add a legend to your plot using the legend function.
legend("a","b","c")
TASK
Create a legend with the labels "Exp A" and "Exp B", in that order.

Task 3
legend("Exp A","Exp B")








You can use a variable's value in plot annotations by concatenating a string with a variable:
bar(data(3,:))
title("Sample " + sample(3) + " Data")

Further Practice
bar(data(3,:))
title("Sample " + sample(3) + " Data")




>> sample
sample =

     3
    18
    19
    20
    21
    23
    38


>> sample(3)
ans =
    19
