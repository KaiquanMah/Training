MATLAB contains built-in constants, such as pi to represent Ï€.
>> a = pi
a = 
    3.1416
Also, although only four decimal places are shown for Ï€, it is represented internally with greater precision.

TASK
Create a variable called x with a value of Ï€/2.
>> x = pi/2
x =
    1.5708









MATLAB contains a wide variety of built-in functions, such as abs (absolute value) and eig (calculate eigenvalues).
>> a = sin(-5)
a = 
    0.9589
Note that MATLAB uses parentheses to pass inputs to functions, similar to standard mathematical notation.

TASK
Use the sin function to calculate the sine of x. Assign the result to a variable named y.
>> y = sin(x)
y =
     1




TASK
Use the sqrt function to calculate the square root of -9. Assign the result to a variable named z.
>> z = sqrt(-9)
z =
   0.0000 + 3.0000i





Note that the solution contains the imaginary number, i, which is a built-in constant in MATLAB.
Only the first four decimal places are displayed in the Command Window. You can control the displayed precision with the format function.
Try entering format long. Then try displaying the value of x.
Enter format short to switch back to the default display.
>> format long
>> x
x =
   1.570796326794897

>> i
ans =
  0.000000000000000 + 1.000000000000000i
