You can extract values from an array using row, column indexing.
y = A(5,7)
This syntax extracts the value in the 5th row and 7th column of A and assigns the result to the variable y.
TASK
Create a variable x that contains the value in the 6th row and 3rd column of the variable data.

Task 1
x=data(6,3)












You can use the MATLAB keyword end as either a row or column index to reference the last element.
y = A(end,2)
TASK
Use the end keyword to obtain the value in the last row and 3rd column of the variable data. Assign this value to a variable named x.

Task 2
x=data(end, 3)








Note that you can use arithmetic with the keyword end. For example:
y = A(end-1,end-2)
TASK
Create a scalar variable x that contains the value in the second to last (end-1) row and 3rd column of data.

Task 3
x=data(end-1, 3)

>> x
x =
    9.0698









If you only use one index with a matrix, it will traverse down each column in order. Using one index, try extracting the eighth element of data.
You can also use variables as your index. Try creating a variable y, and using y as the index to data.

Further Practice
y=data(8)

>> y
y =
    0.5300
