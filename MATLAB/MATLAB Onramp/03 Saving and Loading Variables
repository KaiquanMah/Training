% save variables in your workspace to a MATLAB specific file format called a MAT-file using the save command.
% To save the workspace to a MAT-file named filename.mat, use the command:
% >> save filename
>> save datafile.mat


% clear workspace
clear


%You can load variables from a MAT-file using the load command.
%>> load filename
>> load datafile



%Notice that the variable data is listed in the workspace. You can see contents of any variable by entering the name of the variable.
%>> myvar
>>data
data =
    3.0000    0.5300    4.0753       NaN
   18.0000    1.7800    6.6678    2.1328
   19.0000    0.8600    1.5177    3.6852
   20.0000    1.6000    3.6375    8.5389
   21.0000    3.0000    4.7243   10.1570
   23.0000    6.1100    9.0698    2.8739

%The clear function cleans up the workspace. You can use the clc command to clean up the Command Window.
clc








%When you close MATLAB, the workspace will be cleared. MAT-files can be used to save your variables. The variables can then be loaded into the workspace when you reopen MATLAB.
%If you want to load or save only some of your variables, you can use two inputs to the functions.

%The file myData.mat contains multiple variables. It was previously created for this further practice. Try loading just the variable k:
>> load myData k

%Then try saving the variable k to a new MAT-file called justk.mat:
>> save justk k

>> ls
datafile.mat  justk.mat  myData.mat
