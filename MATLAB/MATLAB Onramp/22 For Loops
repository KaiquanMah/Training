For Loops
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

This code loads the data
load datafile
density = data(:,1);



>> density
density =
    0.5300
    1.7800
    0.8600
    1.6000
    3.0000
    6.1100
    2.5400







When this code is run, the loop body will be executed three times, as the loop counter (c) progresses through the values 1:3 (1, 2, and 3).
TASK
Wrap the code in the second section of the live script (lines 4-7) in a loop so that the code executes 7 times.
Name your loop counter idx. For the first execution of the loop, idx should have a value of 1, and it should increase by 1 each consecutive iteration.


for idx = 1:7,
    
    hold on
    plot(idx,density(idx),"*")
    hold off
    pause(0.2)

end











Did you notice that the plot animates? The code pause(0.2) stops the loop for 0.2 seconds so that the plot will update. Try increasing the animation time by increasing the value of 0.2.
The loop executes 7 times because the density vector has seven elements. If you want to loop over a vector of unknown length, you can use the length function instead:
for idx = 1:length(density)


Further Practice
for idx = 1:length(density),
    
    hold on
    plot(idx,density(idx),"*")
    hold off
    pause(0.2)

end
