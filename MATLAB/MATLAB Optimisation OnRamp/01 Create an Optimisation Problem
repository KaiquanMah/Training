Creating an Optimization Problem 
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.







You can use the optimproblem function to create an optimization problem.

prob = optimproblem("Description",...
"My Optimization Problem");

This creates an empty optimization problem named prob with the label "My Optimization Problem". The label does not impact any computation but can be useful for including descriptive information about your problem.
TASK
Create an optimization problem named prob and add the description "Factory Location".


Task 1
prob = optimproblem("Description","Factory Location")



>> prob

prob = 

  OptimizationProblem with properties:

       Description: 'Factory Location'
    ObjectiveSense: 'minimize'
         Variables: [0×0 struct] containing 0 OptimizationVariables
         Objective: [0×0 OptimizationExpression]
       Constraints: [0×0 struct] containing 0 OptimizationConstraints

  No problem defined.











You can use the show function to display the contents of an optimization problem in an easy-to-read way.

show(problem)

This can be useful as you add more elements to your optimization problem.
TASK
Display the current contents of prob.


Task 2
show(prob)





>> show(prob)

  OptimizationProblem : Factory Location

  No problem defined.










Notice that the output from the show function indicates that no problem is defined. In this example, you created an empty optimization problem. You will add the optimization variables and objective function to the contents of the problem in the following sections.
