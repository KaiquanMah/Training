Asking contextual questions
Sometimes your users need some help! They will have questions and expect the bot to help them.

In this exercise, you'll allow users to ask the coffee bot to explain the steps to them. As in the previous exercise, the answer they get will depend on where they are in the flow.


# Define the states
INIT=0 
CHOOSE_COFFEE=1
ORDERED=2


#Add two rules to your policy_rules to handle the intent "ask_explanation" when in the states INIT or CHOOSE_COFFEE.
# Define the policy rules dictionary
policy_rules = {
    (INIT, "ask_explanation"): (INIT, "I'm a bot to help you order coffee beans"),
    (INIT, "order"): (CHOOSE_COFFEE, "ok, Colombian or Kenyan?"),
    (CHOOSE_COFFEE, "specify_coffee"): (ORDERED, "perfect, the beans are on their way!"),
    (CHOOSE_COFFEE, "ask_explanation"): (CHOOSE_COFFEE, "We have two kinds of coffee beans - the Kenyan ones make a slightly sweeter coffee, and cost $6. The Brazilian beans make a nutty coffee and cost $5.")    
}


#Inside the send_messages() function, call the send_message() function with state and msg as arguments to define the new state. Then, hit 'Submit Answer' to send the messages and see the bot's responses.
# Define send_messages()
def send_messages(messages):
    state = INIT
    for msg in messages:
        state = send_message(state, msg)


# Send the messages
send_messages([
    "what can you do for me?",
    "well then I'd like to order some coffee",
    "what do you mean by that?",
    "kenyan"
])



<script.py> output:
    USER : what can you do for me?
    BOT : I'm a bot to help you order coffee beans
    USER : well then I'd like to order some coffee
    BOT : ok, Colombian or Kenyan?
    USER : what do you mean by that?
    BOT : We have two kinds of coffee beans - the Kenyan ones make a slightly sweeter coffee, and cost $6. The Brazilian beans make a nutty coffee and cost $5.
    USER : kenyan
    BOT : perfect, the beans are on their way!
