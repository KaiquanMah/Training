Pending state transitions
You'll often need to briefly deviate from the flow of a conversation, for example to authenticate a user, before returning to the topic of discussion.

In these cases, it's often simpler - and easier to debug - if you save some actions/states as pending rather than adding ever more complicated rules.

Here, you're going to define a policy_rules dictionary, where the keys are tuples of the current state and the received intent, and the values are tuples of the next state, the bot's response, and a state for which to set a pending transition.




# Define the states
INIT=0
AUTHED=1
CHOOSE_COFFEE=2
ORDERED=3


#Complete the policy_rules dictionary by filling in the values:
#A user starts in the INIT state.
#If the user is in the INIT state and tries to place an order, you should ask for their number and create a pending transition to the AUTHED state.
#This is the only policy rule which creates a pending transition, so the others simply have a pending state value of None.
# Define the policy rules
policy_rules = {
    (INIT, "order"): (INIT, "you'll have to log in first, what's your phone number?", AUTHED),
    (INIT, "number"): (AUTHED, "perfect, welcome back!", None),
    (AUTHED, "order"): (CHOOSE_COFFEE, "would you like Colombian or Kenyan?", None),    
    (CHOOSE_COFFEE, "specify_coffee"): (ORDERED, "perfect, the beans are on their way!", None)
}




#The pending state has been added as the second argument of the send_message() function, which now returns the new state as well as the pending state. Call this send_message() function inside send_messages(), unpacking the output into the variables state and pending.
# Define send_messages()
def send_messages(messages):
    state = INIT
    pending = None
    for msg in messages:
        state, pending = send_message(state, pending, msg)

# Send the messages
send_messages([
    "I'd like to order some coffee",
    "555-1234",
    "kenyan"
])


<script.py> output:
    USER : I'd like to order some coffee
    BOT : you'll have to log in first, what's your phone number?
    USER : 555-1234
    BOT : perfect, welcome back!
    BOT : would you like Colombian or Kenyan?
    USER : kenyan
    BOT : perfect, the beans are on their way!
    
    
Fantastic! You just built a bot that can handle some fairly complicated conversations!
