EchoBot I
Hello, World!
You'll begin learning how to build chatbots in Python by writing two functions to build the simplest bot possible: EchoBot. EchoBot just responds by replying with the same message it receives.
In this exercise, you'll define a function that responds to a user's message. In the next exercise, you'll complete EchoBot by writing a function to send a message to the bot.

Write a function called respond() with a single parameter message which returns the bot's response. To do this, concatenate the strings "I can hear you! You said: " and message.
Store the concatenated strings in bot_message, and return this result.


bot_template = "BOT : {0}"
user_template = "USER : {0}"

# Define a function that responds to a user's message: respond
def respond(message):
    # Concatenate the user's message to the end of a standard bot respone
    bot_message = "I can hear you! You said: " + message
    # Return the result
    return bot_message

# Test function
print(respond("hello!"))

<script.py> output:
    I can hear you! You said: hello!
    





EchoBot II
Having written your respond() function, you'll now define a function called send_message() with a single parameter message which logs the message and the bot's response. 

Use the user_template string's .format() method to include the user's message into the user template, and print the result.
Call the respond() function with the message passed in and save the result as response.
Log the bot's response using the bot_template string's .format() method.
Send the message "hello" to the bot.

# Create templates
bot_template = "BOT : {0}"
user_template = "USER : {0}"

# Define a function that sends a message to the bot: send_message
def send_message(message):
    # Print user_template including the user_message
    print(user_template.format(message))
    # Get the bot's response to the message
    response = respond(message)
    # Print the bot template including the bot's response.
    print(bot_template.format(response))

# Send a message to the bot
send_message("hello")

In [2]: bot_template
Out[2]: 'BOT : {0}'

In [3]: user_template
Out[3]: 'USER : {0}'

<script.py> output:
    USER : hello
    BOT : I can hear you! You said: hello
