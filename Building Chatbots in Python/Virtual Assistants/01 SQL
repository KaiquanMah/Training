SQL basics
Time to begin writing queries for your first hotel booking chatbot! The database has been loaded as "hotels.db" and a cursor, which has access to the database, has already been defined for you as cursor.
Three queries are provided below. Your job is to identify which query returns ONLY the "Hotel California".
You can test each query below by calling the cursor's .execute() method and passing the query in as a string. Then, you can print the results by calling the cursor's .fetchall() method, which takes no arguments.
SELECT name from hotels where price = 'expensive' AND area = 'center'
SELECT name from hotels where price = 'mid' AND area = 'north'
SELECT name from hotels where price = 'expensive'

right:SELECT name from hotels where price = 'mid' AND area = 'north'






SQL statements in Python
It's time to begin writing SQL queries! In this exercise, your job is to run a query against the hotels database to find all the expensive hotels in the south. The connection to the database has been created for you, along with a cursor c.

As Alan described in the video, you should be careful about SQL injection. Here, you'll pass parameters the safe way: As an extra tuple argument to the .execute() method. This ensures malicious code can't be injected into your query.


# Import sqlite3
import sqlite3

# Open connection to DB
conn = sqlite3.connect('hotels.db')

# Create a cursor
c = conn.cursor()


#Define a tuple t of strings "south" and "hi" for the area and price.
# Define area and price
area, price = "south", "hi"
t = (area, price)


#Execute the query using the cursor's .execute() method. You're looking for all of the fields for all hotels where the area is "south" and the price is "hi".
# Execute the query
c.execute('SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE area=? AND price=?', t)


#Print the results using the cursor's .fetchall() method.
# Print the results
print(c.fetchall())

<script.py> output:
    [('Grand Hotel', 'hi', 'south', 5)]

Nice! According to our database, the Grand Hotel is the only high-end hotel in the south.
