Filtering with excluded slots
Now you're going to put together some of the ideas from previous exercises in order to allow users to tell your bot about what they do and do not want, split across multiple messages.

The negated_ents() function has already been defined for you. Additionally, a slightly tweaked version of the find_hotels() function, which accepts a neg_params dictionary in addition to a params dictionary, has been defined.



#Define a respond() function which accepts a message, params, and neg_params as arguments.
# Define the respond function
def respond(message, params, neg_params):
    # Extract the entities
    entities = interpreter.parse(message)["entities"]
    ent_vals = [e["value"] for e in entities]
    
    
    #Use the negated_ents() function with message and ent_vals as arguments. Store the result in negated.
    # Look for negated entities
    negated = negated_ents(message, ent_vals)
    for ent in entities:
        if ent["value"] in negated and negated[ent["value"]]:
            neg_params[ent["entity"]] = str(ent["value"])
        else:
            params[ent["entity"]] = str(ent["value"])
    
    
    #Use the tweaked find_hotels() function with the params and neg_params dictionaries as arguments to find matching hotels. Store the result in results.
    # Find the hotels
    results = find_hotels(params, neg_params)
    names = [r[0] for r in results]
    n = min(len(results),3)
    # Return the correct response
    return responses[n].format(*names), params, neg_params


#Initialize the params and neg_params dictionaries outside the respond() function
# Initialize params and neg_params
params = {}
neg_params = {}

# Pass the messages to the bot
for message in ["I want a cheap hotel", "but not in the north of town"]:
    print("USER: {}".format(message))
    response, params, neg_params = respond(message, params, neg_params)
    print("BOT: {}".format(response))
    

<script.py> output:
    USER: I want a cheap hotel
    BOT: Cozy Cottage is a great hotel!
    USER: but not in the north of town
    BOT: I'm sorry :( I couldn't find anything like that
