Using your custom function to find hotels
Here, you'll see your find_hotels() function in action! Recall that it accepts a single argument, params, which is a dictionary of column names and values.


Create the params dictionary with the column names (keys) "area" and "price", with corresponding values "south" and "lo".
Use the find_hotels() function along with your params dictionary to find all inexpensive hotels in the South.



# Create the dictionary of column names and values
params = {"area": "south",
        "price": "lo"}

# Find the hotels that match the parameters
print(find_hotels(params))


<script.py> output:
    [('Cozy Cottage', 'lo', 'south', 2)]
