#not On premise machines give me full control over the situation when things break.

#yes The cloud can provide you with the resources you need, when you need them.
Correct! This property of cloud computing is also called cloud elasticity.

Cloud services
There are a bunch of cloud services that all have different use cases. It can be hard to keep track of all of them.

Here's an overview of the ones you've seen:
Storage: use the cloud to store unstructured data, like files.
Compute: use virtual machines in the cloud to do complex calculations.
Database: use databases, typically SQL, in the cloud to hold structured data.
In addition, different cloud providers have different names for each of these services...

Classify the services into the correct bucket.
Storage
Amazon S3
Azure Blob Storage
Google Cloud Storage

Compute
Amazon EC2
Azure Virtual Machines
Google Compute Engine

Database
Amazon RDS
Azure SQL DB
Google Cloud SQL


Great! All of these different services can be a bit overwhelming at first, but you'll learn the difference quickly and learn to appreciate the variations.
