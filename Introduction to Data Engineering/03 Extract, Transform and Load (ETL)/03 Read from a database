Read from a database
In this exercise, you're going to extract data that resides inside tables of a local PostgreSQL database. The data you'll be using is the Pagila example database. The database backs a fictional DVD store application, and educational resources often use it as an example database.
https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila
You'll be creating and using a function that extracts a database table into a pandas DataFrame object. The tables you'll be extracting are:
film: the films that are rented out in the DVD store.
customer: the customers that rented films at the DVD store.


In order to connect to the database, you'll have to use a PostgreSQL connection URI, which looks something like this:
postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/database]


Complete the extract_table_to_pandas() function definition to include the table name in the query.
Fill in the connection URI. The host is localhost and port is 5432. The username and password are repl and password, respectively. The database is pagila.
Complete the function calls of extract_table_to_pandas() to extract the film and customer tables.



# Function to extract table to a pandas DataFrame
def extract_table_to_pandas(tablename, db_engine):
    query = "SELECT * FROM {}".format(tablename)
    return pd.read_sql(query, db_engine)

# Connect to the database using the connection URI
#postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/database]
connection_uri = "postgresql://repl:password@localhost:5432/pagila" 
db_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_uri)

In [7]: connection_uri
Out[7]: 'postgresql://repl:password@localhost:5432/pagila'

In [8]: db_engine
Out[8]: Engine(postgresql://repl:***@localhost:5432/pagila)




# Extract the film table into a pandas DataFrame
extract_table_to_pandas("film", db_engine)

# Extract the customer table into a pandas DataFrame
extract_table_to_pandas("customer", db_engine)


The connection URI can also be a link to an external database. Keep in mind that in this case, pulling in full tables can result in loads of network traffic.
