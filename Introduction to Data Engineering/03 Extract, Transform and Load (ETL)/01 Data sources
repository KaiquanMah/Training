Data sources
In the previous video you've learned about three ways of extracting data:
Extract from text files, like .txt or .csv
Extract from APIs of web services, like the Hackernews API
Extract from a database, like a SQL application database for customer data

We also briefly touched upon row-oriented databases and OLTP.
Can you select the statement about these topics which is not true?

OLTP means the system is optimized for transactions.
Row-oriented databases and OLTP go hand-in-hand.

APIs mostly use raw text to transfer data.
Correct! APIs mostly use a more structured form of data, for example JSON.
