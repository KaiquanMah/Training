Uniform distribution
Questions related to the continuous uniform distribution come up during interviews because the calculations associated with this distribution are relatively straightforward.

A random variable is usually denoted as X and a continuous uniform distribution on a range [a,b] is denoted as U(a,b).

Recall that punif(q = k, min = a, max = b) calculates P(X≤k) for X∼U(a,b).

You can derive the probability that a random variable falls into a range as a difference of the two cumulative probabilities: P(j<X<k)=P(X≤k)−P(X≤j)
See the example below for X∼U(2,6):






What is the probability that a random variable from the continuous uniform distribution on the range [1,10] falls into the range [4,7]?
7/10
4/9
3/10

#yes - 1/3
4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7; 3 segments out of 9 segments -> 3/9 = 1/3








Calculate P(X≤7) if X∼U(1,10) and save it as seven_or_lower.
Calculate P(X≤4) if X∼U(1,10) and save it as four_or_lower.

# Probability that X is lower than 7
seven_or_lower <- punif(q = 7, min = 1, max = 10)
print(seven_or_lower)

[1] 0.6666667


# Probability that X is lower or equal to 4
four_or_lower <- punif(q = 4, min = 1, max = 10)
print(four_or_lower)

[1] 0.3333333





Calculate P(4<X<7) if X∼U(1,10) and save it as between_four_and_seven. Use the seven_or_lower and four_or_lower variables.
# Probability that X is lower or equal to 7
seven_or_lower <- punif(q = 7, min = 1, max = 10) 
print(seven_or_lower)

# Probability that X is lower or equal to 4
four_or_lower <- punif(q = 4, min = 1, max = 10) 
print(four_or_lower)

# Probability that X falls into the range [4, 7]
between_four_and_seven <- seven_or_lower - four_or_lower
print(between_four_and_seven)

Great work! You have reviewed the mechanics behind continuous uniform distribution. In the next exercise, you will work with another distribution important to interviewers - the normal distribution!
