Sample from normal distribution
The normal distribution is a frequent topic during interviews due to the vast applications of this distribution.
A random sample is a set of observed items from the whole population. You can make inferences about the population based on a random sample taken from the population. For example, you can calculate the sample probability which is an estimate of the population's true probability.
To compute the sample probability, calculate the proportion of the observations in a sample that meet the given criteria.
To compute the true probability, use probability functions.

Recall that:
the standard normal distribution has μ=0 and σ2=1 (referred to as N(0,1)),
pnorm(q = k) returns P(X≤k) for X∼N(0,1).






Generate 1000 data points from the standard normal distribution.
Draw a histogram of the generated data points.

set.seed(123)

# Generate data points
data_points <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(1))


# Inspect the distribution
hist(x = data_points)









Compute the probability that an observation from the generated sample, data_points, is lower or equal to 2.
Compute the true probability that the random variable from N(0,1) is lower or equal to 2.
set.seed(123)

# Generate data points
data_points <- rnorm(n = 1000)

# Inspect the distribution
hist(data_points)



# Compute the sample probability and print it
sample_probability <- mean(data_points <= 2)
print(sample_probability)
[1] 0.972
 



# Compute the true probability and print it
true_probability <- pnorm(2, mean=0, sd=1)
print(true_probability) 
[1] 0.9772499
 


Awesome! What is the difference between the sample and true probability? How close are the results? Make sure to focus on the normal distribution during your interview preparation as it's important to interviewers. In the next video, we'll move to the Central Limit Theorem.
