Binomial distribution
In the previous exercise, you've modeled the Bernoulli trials. The binomial distribution is the sum of the number of successful outcomes in a set of Bernoulli trials.
The notation of the binomial distribution is B(n,p), where n is the number of experiments, and p is the probability of a success.
For this exercise, consider 10 consecutive fair coin flips. You've bet for tails and consider this outcome of a coin flip as a success.

Recall that:
dbinom(x = k, size = n, prob = p) calculates P(X=k) for X∼B(n,p),
pbinom(q = k, size = n, prob = p) calculates P(X≤k) for X∼B(n,p).
Remember that for discrete distributions that take on whole numbers: P(X≥k)=1−P(X≤k−1).

For example:
So, P(X≥4)=1−P(X≤3).








Assign the probability of getting exactly 6 tails to six_tails and print the result.
Assign the probability of getting 7 or less tails to seven_or_less and print the result.
Assign the probability of getting 5 or more tails to five_or_more and print the result.

# The probability of getting 6 tails
#fair coin => prob=0.5
#10 coin flips => size=10
six_tails <- dbinom(x = 6, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
print(six_tails)

# The probability of getting 7 or less tails
seven_or_less <- pbinom(q = 7, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
print(seven_or_less)

[1] 0.9453125


# The probability of getting 5 or more tails
five_or_more <- 1 - pbinom(q = 4, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
print(five_or_more)

Nice job! Interviewers like to cover the basics of probability theory before they dive into more complex topics. By mastering the basics, you put yourself in a great position during the interview!
