WhatProbability functions
In this lesson, we've covered the syntax of the probability functions in R. It is easy to mix them up in a stressful environment, such as an interview.
You can use the probability functions to generate random data from the given distribution and solve problems involving probabilities.
The names of the functions consist of a prefix and an abbreviated name of the distribution. The prefix indicates the functionality of the function.


Associate each task or question in the top panel with the function to solve it, by dragging and dropping them into the right buckets on the bottom.
rbinom
Generate a random result from fair coin flip
Generate a random result of a basketball shot if the player scores on average 3 out of 10 times

dbinom
What is the probability of exactly 2 successes in 3 trial?s
Roll a die 5 times. What is the probability of getting 6 exactly 3 times?

pbinom
80% of plane flights are on time. What is the probability that maximally 8 out of 10 will be on time?
What is the probability of getting 5 or less tails in 10 coin flips?

Congratulations! You have correctly paired the tasks with the probability functions. Now, let's use the knowledge of probability functions to simulate a set of Bernoulli trials.
