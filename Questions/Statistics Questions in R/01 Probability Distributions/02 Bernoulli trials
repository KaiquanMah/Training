Bernoulli trials
A Bernoulli trial is a random experiment with two possible outcomes: success and failure.
You will imitate the shots of basketball players with various skill levels. Let's assume that the value 1 represents a goal and the value 0 a miss. The outcomes of the shots might be presented as a vector. For example, the vector c(1, 1, 0) means that the player has scored twice and then missed once.
The Bernoulli distribution is a particular case of the binomial distribution where a single trial is conducted (so size amounts to 1).
Recall that bar plots are great for visualizing discrete distributions.



Generate the random results of 10 shots and draw their frequency chart for the player with a goal probability of 0.5.
set.seed(123)

# Generate the outcomes of basketball shots
shots <- rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
print(shots)

 [1] 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0


# Draw the frequency chart of the results
barplot(table(shots))










Generate the random results of 10 shots and draw their frequency chart for the player with a goal probability of 0.3.
set.seed(123)

# Generate the outcomes of basketball shots
shots <- rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = 0.3)
print(shots)

 [1] 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0


# Draw the frequency chart of the results
barplot(table(shots))








Generate the random results of 10 shots and draw their frequency chart for the player with a goal probability of 0.9.
set.seed(123)

# Generate the outcomes of basketball shots
shots <- rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = 0.9)
print(shots)

 [1] 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1



# Draw the frequency chart of the results
barplot(table(shots))

Great work! You've managed to show a real-life situation in the statistical canvas. The Bernoulli trial is the basis of the binomial distribution, which you will master in the next exercise.
