Shape of normal distribution
All normal distributions are symmetric and have a bell-shaped density curve with a single peak.
The normal distribution takes two parameters: the mean (μ) and the variance (σ2). The notation of the normal distribution is N(μ,σ2). The mean indicates where the peak of the density curve occurs, and the variance indicates the spread of the bell curve.
The standard deviation (σ) is the square root of variance (σ2). The rnorm() function takes the standard deviation (sd) as an argument.
We will review descriptive statistics in the next chapter.
In this exercise, you will generate samples from three different normal distributions and visualize their distributions. The libraries tidyr and ggplot2 have been preloaded for this exercise.




How do the mean and the standard deviation impact the density curve of the normal distribution?
A lower mean shifts the graph to the left. A lower standard deviation flattens the curve.
A higher mean shifts the graph to the left. A higher standard deviation flattens the curve.

#yes - A higher mean shifts the graph to the right. A higher standard deviation flattens the curve.





Set the sample size, n, to 50000.
Generate samples of size n from the following three distributions: N(0,1), N(0,3), and N(2,1).
set.seed(123)

# Set the sample size
n = 50000

# Generate random samples from three distributions
sample_N01 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(1))
sample_N03 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(3))
sample_N21 <- rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = sqrt(1))









Run the code and take a look at the generated plot. Which curve belongs to which distribution?
set.seed(123)

# Set the sample size
n = 50000

# Generate random samples from three distributions
sample_N01 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(1))
sample_N03 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(3))
sample_N21 <- rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = sqrt(1))

# Visualize the distributions
data <- data.frame(sample_N01, sample_N03, sample_N21)
data %>% gather(key = distribution, value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = distribution)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3)


Well done! The plot supports your answer on how the mean and the standard deviation impact the density curve. You will tackle the questions on the shape of the normal distribution with ease in the interview. In the next exercise, you will work with true and sample probabilities of the normal distribution.
