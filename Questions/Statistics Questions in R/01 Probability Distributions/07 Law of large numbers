Law of large numbers
In this exercise, you will simulate rolling a standard die numbered 1 through 6.
Simulation of die rolling can be performed using the sample() function.
If you take a sample whose size is bigger than the number of possible values, you need to set the replace parameter of the sample() function to TRUE.
The law of large numbers states that the average of the results obtained from trials will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.


What is the expected value for a die roll?

#yes - 3.5







Generate a sample of 20 die rolls and assign the result tosmall_sample.
Calculate the mean of the small_sample.
Generate a sample of 1000 die rolls and assign the result to big_sample.
Compute the mean of the big_sample.

set.seed(1)

# Create a sample of 20 die rolls
small_sample <- sample(1:6, 
                       size = 20, 
                       replace = 1)

# Calculate the mean of the small sample
mean(small_sample)

[1] 3.85




# Create a sample of 1000 die rolls
big_sample <- sample(1:6, 
                     size = 1000, 
                     replace = 1)

# Calculate the mean of the big sample
mean(big_sample)

[1] 3.494
 
 
 
Nice job! Compare the mean of the small sample with the mean of the big sample. Which of the means is closer to the expected value that you calculated in the first step? The law of large numbers states that with the increase of the sample's size, the mean is closer to the true value. It's important to distinguish between the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem in interviews, so let's practice the CLT.
