ANOVA for plant growth
In this exercise, you will perform a one-way ANOVA to compare means across three groups.
Such a task might pop up during the interviews for various sectors, including engineering, marketing, and medical services.

Recall that the assumptions of ANOVA are:
Independence of cases
Normal distributions
Homogeneity (equality) of variances


You can check the two last assumptions with the Shapiro-Wilk test and Bartlett's test respectively.
The null hypothesis of a one-way ANOVA states that the means across groups are equal.
H0:μ1=μ2=...=μn


Use oneway.test() to perform ANOVA in this exercise.
Watch out! So far, we've used tapply() to compute descriptive statistics across groups. We can use this function to perform statistical tests across groups, too!










Perform a normality test of weight on the data for each group using the PlantGrowth data frame.
Test if variances of weight across groups are equal.

# Test normality across groups
tapply(PlantGrowth$weight, 
       PlantGrowth$group, 
       FUN = shapiro.test)



$ctrl
	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  X[[i]]
W = 0.95668, p-value = 0.7475


$trt1
	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  X[[i]]
W = 0.93041, p-value = 0.4519


$trt2
	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  X[[i]]
W = 0.94101, p-value = 0.5643









# Check the homogeneity of variance
bartlett.test(weight ~ group, 
              data = PlantGrowth)


	Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances

data:  weight by group
Bartlett's K-squared = 2.8786, df = 2, p-value = 0.2371











Do the tests' results imply the violation of ANOVA assumptions?
Yes, the data for weight under the first treatment is non-normal.
Yes, the variance across groups is not homogeneous.
Yes, the samples are not independent.

#yes - No, the results do not imply the violation of ANOVA assumptions.









Numerically assess if the means of weight across groups are equal using a one-way ANOVA.
# Perform one-way ANOVA 
oneway.test(weight ~ group, 
            data = PlantGrowth, 
            var.equal = TRUE)

	One-way analysis of means

data:  weight and group
F = 4.8461, num df = 2, denom df = 27, p-value = 0.01591









What is the result of the test?
There is a difference in average yields across groups because the p-value amounts to 4.8461.
There is no difference in average yields across groups because the p-value amounts to 4.8461.
There is no difference in average yields across groups because the p-value amounts to 0.01591.

#YES - There is a difference in average yields across groups because the p-value amounts to 0.01591.
Yes! The p-value is lower than 5%, so we reject the null hypothesis that the means across groups are equal. The treatment affects the yields! Congratulations on completing chapter 3! In chapter 4, we'll review regression models.
