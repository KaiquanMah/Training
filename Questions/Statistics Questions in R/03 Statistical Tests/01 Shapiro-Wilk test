Shapiro-Wilk test
In this exercise, you will check the normality of data.
Normal data is an underlying assumption for many statistical tests. You need to know how to assess the normality of the data before you run these statistical tests during the interview.
The Shapiro-Wilk test is a popular test for testing normality.
Recall that the log transformation can be used to transform skewed data to approximately conform to normality.



The cats dataset from the MASS package has been preloaded for this exercise. As you may remember, the Hwt variable from this dataset contains data on heart weight in grams.
Plot a histogram of the Hwt variable from cats.
Perform the normality test that has the best power for a given significance on the Hwt variable.
# Plot the distribution of Hwt
hist(cats$Hwt)

# Assess the normality of Hwt numerically
shapiro.test(cats$Hwt)

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  cats$Hwt
W = 0.96039, p-value = 0.0003654









What is the result of the Shapiro-Wilk test on Hwt?
You cannot reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.0003654.
You cannot reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.96039.
You reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.96039.

#yes - You reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.0003654.




Determine the shape of the logarithm of Hwt distribution.
Perform the normality test that has the best power for a given significance on the logarithm of the Hwt variable.
# Plot the distribution of the logarithm of Hwt
hist(log(cats$Hwt))

# Assess the normality of the logarithm of Hwt numerically
shapiro.test(log(cats$Hwt))

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  log(cats$Hwt)
W = 0.9942, p-value = 0.8333








What is the result of the Shapiro-Wilk test on the logarithm of Hwt?
You reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.8333
You reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.9942
You cannot reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.9942


#yes - You cannot reject the null hypothesis because the p-value amounts to 0.8333


Awesome! The p-value is greater than 5%. Hence there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the sample comes from a population that has a normal distribution. The bell-shaped histogram supports this hypothesis. During the interview, keep in mind that there is still a risk of type II error.
