Confidence interval
The confidence interval is a range in which we suspect the population's mean to land.
You may expect questions on confidence intervals if your future project touches behavioral or medical science, politics, or advertising.
In this exercise, you'll practice computing confidence intervals using the sleep dataset from the datasets package. The dataset contains data on the effect of two drugs on ten patients. The effect is measured as an increase in hours of sleep compared to control, which is stored in the extra column.
A confidence interval is stored in the conf.int component of an object created with t.test().


You can retrieve it like this:
t.test(x)$conf.int
Watch out! To run a t-test, your data needs to be normally distributed.





If we increase the confidence level, how does the confidence interval change?
The confidence interval narrows.
The confidence interval stays the same.

#yes - The confidence interval widens.







Run the Shapiro-Wilk test on the extra variable from the sleep data frame to test the normality of data.
Calculate the mean of extra for the sample data.
Compute a confidence interval for the default confidence level of 95%.
# Test normality of extra
shapiro.test(sleep$extra)

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  sleep$extra
W = 0.94607, p-value = 0.3114



# Calculate mean of extra
mean(sleep$extra)
[1] 1.54



# Derive 95% confidence interval
t.test(sleep$extra)$conf.int

[1] 0.5955845 2.4844155
attr(,"conf.level")
[1] 0.95








Compute a confidence interval for the confidence level 90%.
Compute a confidence interval for the confidence level 99%.
# Derive 90% confidence interval
t.test(sleep$extra, conf.level=0.90)$conf.int


[1] 0.7597797 2.3202203
attr(,"conf.level")
[1] 0.9


# Derive 99% confidence interval
t.test(sleep$extra, conf.level=0.99)$conf.int

[1] 0.2490875 2.8309125
attr(,"conf.level")
[1] 0.99


Awesome! Even though the sample's mean amounts to 1.54, the population's mean might be somewhere between 0.60 and 2.48 with 95% confidence. Showing that you can build confidence intervals instead of trusting only the sample's mean puts you in a great position during the interview.
