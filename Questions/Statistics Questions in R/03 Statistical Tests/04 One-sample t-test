One-sample t-test
In the last exercise, you used the t.test() function to derive a confidence interval. In this exercise, you will use this function to test if the population's mean amounts to a specific value.
You can get asked about the one-sample t-test if your future role involves testing a sample against a specific benchmark.
In this exercise, you will once again work with the sleep dataset from the datasets package.


The dataset contains the following variables:
group - indicates which drug has been given to a patient (either 1 or 2),
extra - an increase in hours of sleep compared to control.
You will perform the one-sample t-test twice - once for the first group and once for the second group.





What is the null hypothesis of the one-sample t-test?
The population's mean is different than a given value.
The underlying distribution is normal.
The sample needs to be random.

#yes - The population's mean equals the hypothesized mean.









Subset the observations of group 1.
Subset the observations of group 2.
# Subset data for group 1
group1 <- subset(sleep, group == 1)

# Subset data for group 2
group2 <- subset(sleep, group == 2)








Perform a one-sample t-test to check if the population's mean of extra for group 1 equals 2.2.
Perform a one-sample t-test to check if the population's mean of extra for group 2 equals 2.2.
# Test if mean of extra for group 1 amounts to 2.2
t.test(group1$extra, mu = 2.2)

	One Sample t-test

data:  group1$extra
t = -2.563, df = 9, p-value = 0.03053
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 2.2
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.5297804  2.0297804
sample estimates:
mean of x 
     0.75





# Test if mean of extra for group 2 amounts to 2.2
t.test(group2$extra, mu = 2.2)

	One Sample t-test

data:  group2$extra
t = 0.20532, df = 9, p-value = 0.8419
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 2.2
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.8976775 3.7623225
sample estimates:
mean of x 
     2.33




Well done! The tests show that you would reject the null hypothesis that the population's mean amounts to 2.2 for the first group, but not for the second. You may encounter such a task during an interview for a company that makes inferences about a population. In the next lesson, we will review the two-sample t-test.
