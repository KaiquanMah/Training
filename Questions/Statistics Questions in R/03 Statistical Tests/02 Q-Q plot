Q-Q plot
During the interview, you can use a Q-Q plot to support the result of the Shapiro-Wilk test.
A Q-Q plot that compares a certain sample data against the values of a normal distribution helps to assess the normality of the sample visually.

Recall that:
qqplot(x, y) - produces a Q-Q plot of two datasets,
qqnorm(x) - produces a Q-Q plot against normal distribution.

The line added by qqline(x) is by default normal.
The cats dataset from the MASS package is available for this exercise.







Which of the below sentences about the Q-Q plot is true?
A point on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution.
A Q-Q plot is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.
If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points will approximately lie on the line.

#yes - All of the above answers are true.







Draw a normal Q-Q plot for the Hwt variable from the cats data frame.
Add a reference line to the plot.
# Draw a Q-Q plot for Hwt
qqnorm(cats$Hwt)

# Add a reference line
qqline(cats$Hwt)








Draw a normal Q-Q plot for the logarithm of the Hwt variable from the cats data frame.
Add a reference line to the plot.
# Draw a Q-Q plot for Hwt
qqnorm(cats$Hwt)

# Add a reference line
qqline(cats$Hwt)

# Draw a Q-Q plot for logarithm of Hwt
qqnorm(log(cats$Hwt))

# Add a reference line
qqline(log(cats$Hwt))

Well done! Take a look at the Q-Q plots that you've created. The sample follows a normal distribution if the points are linear. For your initial data, the points on the Q-Q plot were not lying on the reference line. After the log transformation, the points approximately lie on the line. You must be able to explain the conclusions stemming from a Q-Q plot during the interview.
