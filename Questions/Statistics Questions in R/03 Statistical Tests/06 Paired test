Paired test
In the previous lesson, you've worked on the sleep dataset. The dataset contains data on the effect of two drugs on the increase in sleep hours.
In the case of this experiment, the data are pairs of measurements. The same people were tested with each of the drugs. If data contain pairs of measurements, you should use a paired test. It is worth keeping this distinction in mind during the interview.
To carry out a paired test, set the paired parameter of the t.test() function to TRUE.
The dataset is available as sleep in your environment. Recall that extra is the increase in the number of sleep hours, and group indicates which drug has been given.



Assign the increase in the sleep hours of the first group to drug1.
Assign the increase in the sleep hours of the second group to drug2.
> sleep$group == 1
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
[13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE

> sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1]
 [1]  0.7 -1.6 -0.2 -1.2 -0.1  3.4  3.7  0.8  0.0  2.0
 
 
# Subset the first group
drug1 <- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1]

# Subset the second group
drug2 <- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 2]







Carry out a paired test for drug1 and drug2.

# Perform paired test
t.test(extra ~ group, 
       data=sleep, 
       paired = TRUE)


	Paired t-test

data:  extra by group
t = -4.0621, df = 9, p-value = 0.002833
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -2.4598858 -0.7001142
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
                  -1.58





# Perform paired test
t.test(drug1,
       drug2,
       paired = TRUE)


	Paired t-test

data:  drug1 and drug2
t = -4.0621, df = 9, p-value = 0.002833
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -2.4598858 -0.7001142
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
                  -1.58







What is the conclusion of the test?
The means of the populations are equal for the 95% confidence level.
The result of the test is inconclusive on any confidence level.

#yes - The means of the populations are not equal for the 95% confidence level.


Awesome! You can distinguish between drawing samples from two populations and measuring the impact of a factor on the same group of objects. In the next lesson, we will compare several samples at the same time.
