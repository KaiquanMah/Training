Two-sample t-test
A two-sample t-test is used to test if the means of two populations equal.
The examples of analyses that quantify the impact of a factor include testing a pharmaceutical drug on patients or a marketing campaign on demand.


Recall that few assumptions need to be met to carry out a two-sample t-test:
Random samples
Independent observations
Normally distributed underlying data
Homogeneity of variances


The former two assumptions need to be met at the stage of designing the experiment. The latter two assumptions can be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Bartlett's test respectively.
A company provided you with the df data frame. The sample column indicates the sample, and the value column contains numerical data. The dplyr package is available in your environment.






Print the first 6 rows of df.
Retrieve values and run the Shapiro-Wilk test on the first sample.
Retrieve values and run the Shapiro-Wilk test on the second sample.
# Return the first part of df
head(df)

     value sample
1 72.19762      1
2 73.84911      1
3 82.79354      1
4 75.35254      1
5 75.64644      1

# Test normality of sample 1
sample1 <- df %>% 
  filter(sample == 1) %>% 
  select(value) %>% 
  pull()

shapiro.test(sample1)


	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  sample1
W = 0.99838, p-value = 0.4765







# Test normality of sample 2
sample2 <- df %>% 
  filter(sample == 2) %>% 
  select(value) %>% 
  pull()


shapiro.test(sample2)

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  sample2
W = 0.99862, p-value = 0.6316














Perform Bartlett's test on the two samples.
# Test equality of variances
bartlett.test(value ~ sample, 
              data = df)


	Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances

data:  value by sample
Bartlett's K-squared = 0.32233, df = 1, p-value = 0.5702






What can you derive from the Shapiro-Wilk and Bartlett's tests?
There is no evidence to reject the hypothesis that the underlying data are normal. The hypothesis on the homogeneity of variances has been rejected.
The hypothesis on the normality of data has been rejected. There is no evidence to reject the hypothesis on the homogeneity of variances.
The hypotheses on the normality of the underlying data and the homogeneity of variances have been rejected.

#yes - There is no evidence to reject the hypothesis that the underlying data comes from the normally distributed populations, nor that the variances are equal.








Carry out a two-sample t-test on the data samples; what is the result of the analysis?
# Test equality of means 
t.test(value ~ sample, 
       data = df, 
       var.equal = TRUE)


	Two Sample t-test

data:  value by sample
t = 21.756, df = 1998, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 4.429468 5.307158
sample estimates:
mean in group 1 mean in group 2 
       75.08064        70.21233


Well done! You've proved that the means of the two populations differ. You can make a statistically significant insight from the data at hand. Your knowledge will be an excellent asset for your future employer!
