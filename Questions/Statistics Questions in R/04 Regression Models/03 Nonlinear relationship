Nonlinear relationship
Covariance and correlation measure the strength of a linear relationship.
If these metrics are low, it doesn't mean that the variables are not related at all!
In some cases, you can achieve linearity using a transformation of one or more of the variables. If your data is heavily skewed, a log-transformation usually helps.
In your environment, you can find the houses data frame with two variables: area and price.





Draw a scatter plot of price explained by area from the houses data frame; are the variables related?
Compute the correlation coefficient between price and area; what does the result tell about the relationship between variables?

> houses
          price      area
1     16262.567 117.59267
2     66343.169 130.84232
3      8907.010 111.78157
...
100   26649.025 122.37848





# Draw a scatterplot of price vs. area
plot(price ~ area, data = houses)

# Calculate the correlation coefficient of price and area
cor(houses$price, houses$area)

[1] 0.6810749
 







Draw a histogram of price; is the distribution skewed?
Draw a scatter plot of logarithm of price explained by area; how did the relationship change?
Compute the correlation coefficient between logarithm of price and area.
# Draw a histogram of price
hist(houses$price)

#houses$price is right skewed
#therefore, perform a log transformation on houses$price


# Draw a scatterplot of log price vs. area
plot(log(price) ~ area, data = houses)

# Calculate the correlation coefficient of log price and area
cor(log(houses$price), houses$area)

[1] 0.9989026



Good job! The correlation coefficient between price and area is low. The variables are certainly related, but not linearly! The log-transformation has helped to increase the correlation coefficient from 0.68 to almost 1! In the next lesson, we'll review linear models!
