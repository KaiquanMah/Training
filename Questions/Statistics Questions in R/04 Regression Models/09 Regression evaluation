Regression evaluation
The test_set and model objects that you have derived in the previous exercise are available in your environment.
It's useful to present the accuracy of predictions with one number. You can then easily compare several models and show the progress to your employer or future employer.
Root Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error are widely used to evaluate the regression models.



Assign the Hwt variable from the test set to y.
Calculate the predictions using the test set and assign them to y_hat.
Assign the number of rows of the test set to n.
# Assign Hwt from the test set to y
y <- test_set$Hwt

# Predict Hwt on the test set
y_hat <- predict(model, 
                 newdata = test_set)

# Derive the test set's size
n <- nrow(test_set)

Brilliant! The RMSE and MAE carry information on how good your model is at predicting. You've calculated these metrics by hand, which is a great skill to show during the interview. You can also use functions from packages to calculate these metrics, for example Metrics::rmse() and Metrics::mae().
