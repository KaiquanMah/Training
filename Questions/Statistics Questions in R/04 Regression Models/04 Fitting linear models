Fitting linear models
If your future role involves building predictive models, the interviewer might be interested in testing your knowledge of linear regression.
Linear regression models are one of the basic forms of predicting values for linearly related data. Linear regression model requires normality and homoscedasticity of the errors. If you fit a linear regression model during the interview, ensure that these assumptions are met.
You are already familiar with the cats dataset. The dataset is available in your environment. To add a regression line to the plot, you can use abline() applied on a linear model's object.



Draw the scatterplot of Bwt on the x-axis and Hwt on the y-axis.
Fit a linear regression model explaining heart weight by body weight.
Add the regression line to the scatterplot.
# Draw the scatterplot
plot(Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)

# Fit the linear model
model <- lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)

# Add the regression line
abline(model)







Draw the linear model's diagnostic plots.
# Invoke diagnostic plots
plot(model)


> print(model)

Call:
lm(formula = Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)          Bwt  
    -0.3567       4.0341







What can you conclude about the residuals from the diagnostic plots?
In the Q-Q plot, the residuals line far away from the dashed line, which implies a non-normal distribution. In the Scale-Location plot, the smooth line is roughly horizontal, which implies homoscedasticity of residuals.
In the Q-Q plot, the residuals line far away from the dashed line, which implies a non-normal distribution. In the Scale-Location plot, the smooth line shows a steep angle, which implies heteroscedasticity of residuals.
In the Q-Q plot, the residuals lie mostly on a dashed line, which indicates normality of distribution. In the Scale-Location plot, the smooth line shows a steep angle, which implies heteroscedasticity of residuals.

#yes - In the Q-Q plot, the residuals lie mostly on a dashed line, which indicates normality of distribution. In the Scale-Location plot, the smooth line is roughly horizontal, which implies homoscedasticity of residuals.
Awesome! It's easy to fit a model; it's more difficult to state if the model is accurate. During the interview, show that you are aware of the assumptions of a linear regression by producing and commenting on the diagnostic plots!
