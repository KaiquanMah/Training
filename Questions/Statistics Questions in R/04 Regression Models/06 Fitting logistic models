Fitting logistic models
Many business problems require the prediction of a binary response variable. Your future employer may need to detect spam e-mails, credit card frauds, or rare diseases.
The logistic regression model is the go-to method for binary classification problems.
In this exercise, you will use Parkinson's dataset from the UCI repository. This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from people with and without Parkinson's disease.


You will use the following variables from the dataset:
status - 1 - if a person has Parkinson's disease, 0 - otherwise,
NHR - a measure of the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice,
DFA - a signal fractal scaling exponent.





The dataset is available as parkinsons.
Draw a scatterplot of status against NHR from the parkinsons dataset.
Draw a scatterplot of status against DFA from the parkinsons dataset.
# Plot status vs NHR
plot(status ~ NHR, 
     data = parkinsons)

# Plot status vs DFA
plot(status ~ DFA, 
     data = parkinsons)








Fit a logistic model that explains status by NHR and DFA.
Print the logistic model.
# Fit the logistic model
model <- glm(status ~ NHR + DFA,
             data = parkinsons, 
             family = "binomial")

# Print the model
print(model)


Call:  glm(formula = status ~ NHR + DFA, family = "binomial", data = parkinsons)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)          NHR          DFA  
     -8.707       49.188       12.702  

Degrees of Freedom: 194 Total (i.e. Null);  192 Residual
Null Deviance:	    217.6 
Residual Deviance: 187.7 	AIC: 193.7


Amazing! You've built a simple logistic model that proves your knowledge of the concept to the interviewer. In the next exercise, you will use your model for predictions.
