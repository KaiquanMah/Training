Predicting with linear models
The skill of prediction is necessary if you apply for positions such as a magician, a clairvoyant, or a data scientist.
Regression models can be used to predict an dependent variable for new data points. You can easily predict with R functions, but it's worth knowing how the results are computed.

The following variables are available in the environment:
cats - the dataset from the MASS package,
model - the linear regression model that you've fitted in the last exercise,
new_cat - the value of bodyweight for a new cat.






Print data for the new_cat.
Print the linear regression model.
# Print the new cat's data
print(new_cat)

   Bwt
1 2.55



# Print the linear model
print(model)

Call:
lm(formula = Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)          Bwt  
    -0.3567       4.0341







Compute by hand the prediction for the new_cat's body weight. Use four decimal places for the intercept and the slope parameter.
Print the prediction.
# Calculate Hwt prediction
#Coefficients:
#(Intercept)          Bwt  
#    -0.3567       4.0341
prediction <- -0.3567 + 4.0341 * 2.55

# Print the predicted value
print(prediction)

[1] 9.930255








Compute the prediction for the new_cat using a function.
# Predict Hwt for the new cat
predict(model, 
        newdata = new_cat)

Fabulous! You've predicted that the heart weight of a cat weighing 2.55kg will amount to 9.39g. With each exercise, you are better prepared for your job interview. In the next lesson, we will review logistic regression!
