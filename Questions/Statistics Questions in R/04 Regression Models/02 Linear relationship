Linear relationship
You can spot a correlation in the business landscape around you. If the demand rises, the price increases. On a macro scale, if the consumers spend more, the GDP increases.
The correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.
In this exercise, you will analyze the linear relationship on the women dataset from the datasets package. The dataset is available as women in the environment.
The dataset includes the average heights and weights for American women aged 30-39.





Draw the scatter plot of height on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis from the women dataset.
# Draw the scatterplot
plot(women$height, women$weight)

#scatterplot points with a smooth line joining the points
scatter.smooth(women$height, women$weight)









What is the value of the correlation coefficient between height and weight?
Close to âˆ’1.
Around 0.
Around 0.6.

#yes - Close to 1.









Calculate the covariance for the height and weight variables from the women dataset.
Calculate the correlation coefficient for the height and weight variables from the women dataset.
# Compute the covariance
cov(women$height, women$weight)

[1] 69



# Compute the correlation
cor(women$height, women$weight)

[1] 0.9954948



Great job! The calculation of correlation coefficients is a quick way to reveal linear relationships. When you communicate the results during the interview, remember to note that the correlation does not imply causation. You can't legitimately deduce a cause-and-effect relationship solely based on an observed correlation between two variables.
