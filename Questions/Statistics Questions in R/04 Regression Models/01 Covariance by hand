Covariance by hand
In R, you can quickly compute various statistical measures using functions. The interviewer might be interested if you can replicate the calculations of these functions to ensure your understanding of what the functions do.
In this exercise, you will compute covariance by hand. The covariance measures the variability of two random variables.

Recall that the formula for the covariance of a sample is:
n
∑ (xi−x¯)(yi−y¯) / (n−1)
i=1


The df data frame is available in your environment with variables x and y.
Assign the number of observations in df to n.
Compute the covariance between x and y by hand.
Compute the covariance between x and y using a function from the stats package.

> df
              x          y
1   28.75775201  30.757531
2   78.83051354  75.486984
...
100 51.15054599  52.607887




# The number of observations
n <- nrow(df)

# Compute covariance by hand
sum((df$x-mean(df$x))*(df$y-mean(df$y)))/(n-1)

[1] 799.102


# Compute covariance with function
cov(df$x, df$y)

[1] 799.102




Awesome! Have you checked if the results of your formula and the cov() function are the same? The functions in R make our lives easier, but there are times we need to ensure that the functions return the expected outcome. The skill to replicate the result of a built-in function proves to your future employer that you know what happens behind the scenes.
