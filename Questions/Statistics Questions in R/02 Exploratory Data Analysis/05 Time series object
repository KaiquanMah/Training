Time series object
Many companies gather time-dependent data to look for trends or seasonal variations. As time is irregular, wrangling time-dependent data might be hard, especially in a stressful setting, such as a job interview.
Coercing data to a time series object makes it easier to analyze such datasets.

The xts object takes the following arguments:
x - a set of values,
order.by - a set of corresponding dates (which need to be of the Date class).

In this exercise, you will work with natural gas prices. The dataset contains two variables:
Price - numerical values,
Date - dates stored as factors.









The gas dataset is available in your environment.
> str(gas)
'data.frame':	5702 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ Date : Factor w/ 5702 levels "1997-01-07","1997-01-08",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ Price: num  3.82 3.8 3.61 3.92 4 4.01 4.34 4.71 3.91 3.26 ...

library(xts)

# View the structure of gas
str(gas)

# Coerce to date class
gas$Date <- as.Date(gas$Date,
                 format="%Y-%m-%d")
                 
                 
> str(gas)
'data.frame':	5702 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ Date : Date, format: "1997-01-07" "1997-01-08" ...
 $ Price: num  3.82 3.8 3.61 3.92 4 4.01 4.34 4.71 3.91 3.26 ...                 












Create an xts object from the gas dataset and assign it to the gas_ts variable.
Plot the price of gas over time.
library(xts)

# View the structure of gas
str(gas)

# Coerce to date class
gas$Date <- as.Date(gas$Date)

# Create the xts object
gas_ts <- xts(x = gas$Price, 
              order.by = gas$Date)

# Plot the time series
plot(gas_ts)

That's awesome! In just a few lines of code, you created a meaningful plot of the price. Take a look at the plot. Which period seems interesting? During the interview, communicate the conclusions you draw from the plots you create.
