Variability measures
Measures of central tendency represent the center point of values in a dataset. Measures of variability represent the extent to which a distribution is stretched or squeezed.
The measures of variability give you a fuller picture of the data at hand during the interview. The most popular measures of variability are variance and standard deviation.
In this exercise, you will once again work with the cats dataset from the MASS package. The dataset has been preloaded for you as cats.
The dataset contains information on the sex, heart weight, and body weight of domestic cats. The value "F" in the Sex column indicates a female cat, and the value "M" indicates a male cat.


Subset data for female cats from the cats dataset and assign them to the female_cats variable.
Calculate the variance for the Bwt variable for female cats.

> female_cats
   Sex Bwt  Hwt
1    F 2.0  7.0
2    F 2.0  7.4
3    F 2.0  9.5
...


# Subset female cats
female_cats <- subset(cats, Sex == "F")

# Compute the variance of Bwt for females 
var(female_cats$Bwt)

[1] 0.07506938
 









Subset data for male cats and assign them to the male_cats variable.
Calculate the variance for the Bwt variable for male cats.
# Subset male cats
male_cats <- subset(cats, Sex == "M")

# Compute the variance of Bwt for males
var(male_cats$Bwt)

[1] 0.2185417






What can you conclude from the calculated variability measures?

The male cats' body weight data are more concentrated around the mean.
The variability of male and female cats' body weight is equal.

#YES - The distribution of the Bwt variable for the female cats is more squeezed.
Great work! An analysis of variability could be also carried out using the standard deviation instead of variance. Recall that the function for the standard deviation is sd(). In the next lesson, we will cover categorical data.
