Centrality measures
The primary purpose of descriptive statistics is to provide a summary of the data. Descriptive statistics might prove useful if you need to quickly get a grasp of the data at hand during the interview.
The most recognized types of descriptive statistics are measures of central tendency, also known as centrality measures.

In this exercise, you will work with the cats dataset from the MASS package. The cats dataset contains the following variables:
Sex - sex,
Bwt - body weight, and
Hwt - heart weight
of domestic cats.

By calculating central tendency measures, you'll be able to answer questions about the skewness of the data.
Recall the relationship between the mean and the median in skewed distributions.
The dataset has been preloaded as cats.







Calculate the mean of the Hwt variable from the cats dataset.
Calculate the median of the Hwt variable from the cats dataset.
# Compute the average of Hwt
mean(cats$Hwt)

[1] 10.63056



# Compute the median of Hwt
median(cats$Hwt)
[1] 10.1
 




Is the distribution of the Hwt variable skewed?
Yes, the distribution of Hwt is skewed to the left.
No, the distribution of Hwt is perfectly symmetrical.

#yes - Yes, the distribution of Hwt is skewed to the right.








Draw a histogram of the Hwt variable from the cats dataset.
# Inspect the distribution of Hwt
hist(cats$Hwt)


Awesome! The mean is higher than the median, which implies that the data is piled up to the left. The histogram verifies that the distribution is skewed to the right. Now let's move to variability measures!
