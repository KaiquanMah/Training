Outlier detection
A very important aspect of preprocessing your data correctly is outlier detection. In machine learning interview questions, a common question is how to locate and process outliers. An easy way to detect outliers is by visualizing them graphically.
After finding and imputing missing data, finding and figuring out what to do about outliers is another necessary preprocessing step.
There's a variety of packages that let you visualize outliers, but in this exercise, you will be using seaborn to plot univariate and multivariate boxplots of selected columns of loan_data.
All relevant packages have been imported for you.

Where are you with the pipeline?
preprocess data







Create a univariate boxplot using the feature Annual Income from loan_data.
Create a multivariate boxplot conditioned on Loan Status using the feature Annual Income from loan_data.
# Import modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Univariate and multivariate boxplots
fig, ax =plt.subplots(1,2)
sns.boxplot(y=loan_data['Annual Income'], ax=ax[0])
sns.boxplot(x='Loan Status', y='Annual Income', data=loan_data, ax=ax[1])
plt.show()









Create a univariate boxplot using the feature Monthly Debt from loan_data.
Create a multivariate boxplot conditioned on Loan Status using the feature Monthly Debt from loan_data.
# Import modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Multivariate boxplot
fig, ax =plt.subplots(1,2)
sns.boxplot(y=loan_data['Monthly Debt'], ax=ax[0])
sns.boxplot(x='Loan Status', y='Monthly Debt', data=loan_data, ax=ax[1])
plt.show()









Create a univariate boxplot using the feature Years of Credit History from loan_data.
Create a multivariate boxplot conditioned on Loan Status using the feature Years of Credit History from loan_data.

# Import modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Univariate and multivariate boxplots
fig, ax =plt.subplots(1,2)
sns.boxplot(x=loan_data['Years of Credit History'], ax=ax[0])
sns.boxplot(x='Loan Status', y='Years of Credit History', data=loan_data, ax=ax[1])
plt.show()



Great! Scroll through the plots again if you didn't come to your own conclusion that loan_data has outliers that need to be addressed. On to the next exercise where you'll learn what to do about these outliers!
