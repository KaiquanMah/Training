What is the optimal k?
How do you decide on the optimal number of clusters in a partitive clustering algorithm such as K-Means?


Select the answer that is true:
The silhouette score returns the mean silhouette coefficient, which can be a value from 0 to 1 depending on how stable the clusters are.
The lowest silhouette score indicates the highest cluster stability.
Select the lowest sum of the squared distances from observations to their nearest cluster center, given as the inertia_ attribute from a trained KMeans() model.

#yes - Once a K-means model has been trained on several values for k, both the elbow method and silhouette methods can be used to decide on the best value for the number of clusters.
Yes, that's right! It's best to try both the elbow and silhouette methods on a given dataset to ensure their results are the same.
