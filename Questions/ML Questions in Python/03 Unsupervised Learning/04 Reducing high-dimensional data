Reducing high-dimensional data
In the video lesson, you saw how to use PCA and T-SNE to reduce dimensionality and visualize the new dimensions.


Select the answer that is false:
A PCA() object can be instantiated and n_components set to the desired principal components to be returned, then a scree plot used to visually examine the PCA.explained_variance_ratio_ attribute.
Setting n_components in a TSNE() object to the number of classes in the target variable can allow visualization of the probabilistic separation of the classes in a low-dimensional embedded space.
The first principal component in PCA is the direction deemed as having the maximal variance in the dataset after translating, rotating, and scaling.

#yes - A dataset with 30 features can be reduced to 5 principal components using either PCA or t-sne and visualized.
Yes, this is incorrect one! It is not feasible, nor warranted to attempt visualizing more than 3 dimensions.
