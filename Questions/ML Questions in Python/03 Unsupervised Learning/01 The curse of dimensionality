The curse of dimensionality
How do PCA and SVD algorithms help overcome the curse of dimensionality?


Select the statement below that is true:
PCA uses the direction of lowest variance and assigns it as the first principal component.
PCA returns a subset of the original features that can still be correlated with each other.
SVD is used for dimensionality reduction, returning a subset of the original features.

#YES - SVD decomposes the original data matrix into three matrices and returns singular values.
Right! Singular Value Decomposition uses linear algebra and vector calculus to decompose the data into singular values.
