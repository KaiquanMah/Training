Clustering algorithms
What's the best way to determine which clustering algorithm should be used for a given dataset?



Select the answer that is false:
The inter-cluster distance should be greater than the intra-cluster distance when assessing cluster stability.
Assessing the Euclidian distance metric from K-means and hierarchical clustering and selecting the algorithm with the lowest metric is best.

#YES - Comparing different distance metrics between different clustering algorithms is the best way to select which algorithm to use.
Great job! When comparing different clustering algorithms, you must make sure they are comparable by assessing the same distance metric between them, not different distance metrics.
