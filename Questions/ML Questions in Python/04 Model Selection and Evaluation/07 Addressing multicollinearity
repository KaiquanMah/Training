Addressing multicollinearity
After careful exploratory data analysis, you realize that your baseline regression model suffers from multicollinearity. How would you check if that is true or not? Without losing any information, can you build a better baseline model?


Select the answer that is false:
Create a correlation matrix and/or heatmap, then engineer features to combine multicollinear independent variables, making sure to remove the individual features used to create any new features.
Create a correlation matrix and/or heatmap, then perform Ridge regression to penalize multicollinear independent variables and perform feature selection for modeling.
Create a correlation matrix and/or heatmap, then perform PCA to combine multicollinear independent variables as new principal components.

#YES - Create a correlation matrix and/or heatmap, then remove the multicollinear independent variables.
Almost! While you can remove ONE of the variables when they show a high degree of correlation, you wouldn't want to remove all of them.
