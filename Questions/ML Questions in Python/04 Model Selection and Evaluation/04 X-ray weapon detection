X-ray weapon detection
You are given a data set on detecting weapons at major US airports and have built a classification model with an accuracy of 99%. Why should you question the performance of the model? How should you proceed to ensure the model is indeed performing well?


Select the answer that is true:
When a dataset has imbalanced classes, a high recall score indicates a high number of false negatives, so continue to tune hyperparameters.
When a dataset has imbalanced classes, a low f1 score indicates indicates a good balance between precision and recall, from which it is calculated, so nothing more is needed for model improvement.
When a dataset has imbalanced classes, a high accuracy score indicates the model will generalize well, so no adjustments need to be made to improve the model.

#yes - When a dataset has imbalanced classes, a low precision score indicates a high number of false positives, so consider trying different classification algorithms and/or resampling techniques to improve precision.
Indeed! A low precision score indicates that there are too many false positives, bringing the calculation down. Seeking to reduce the number of false positives to increase the precision can be accomplished with trying different classification algorithms and/or resampling techniques.
