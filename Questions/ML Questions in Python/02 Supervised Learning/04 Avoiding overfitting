Avoiding overfitting
What techniques can be used to ensure youâ€™re not overfitting the dataset for a regression model?



Select the answer that is true:
Perform Ridge regression which uses L2-norm regularization which adds a penalty term composed of the penalty parameter alpha multiplied by the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.
Perform Lasso regression which uses L1-ratio regularization which adds a penalty term composed of the penalty parameter alpha multiplied by the sum of the squared coefficients.
Perform ElasticNet regression which uses L1-norm regularization which adds a penalty terms composed of the penalty parameter alpha multiplied by the sum of the L1 and L2 norms.

#YES - Perform ElasticNet regression which uses l1-ratio regularization which is a combination of L1 and L2.
Exactly right! ElasticNet is a hybrid combination of L1/L2 called the L1-ratio that can lie anywhere between L1 and L2-norms.
