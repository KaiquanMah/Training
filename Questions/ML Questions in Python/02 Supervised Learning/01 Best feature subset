Best feature subset
How do you select the optimal subset of independent variables in a regression model?
As a reminder, filter methods rank features based on their statistical performance while wrapper, embedded and tree-based methods use a machine learning model to evaluate performance.


Select the statement that is true:
Filter methods, which use an ML model, rank features by correlation with the target variable and always provide the best subset.
Wrapper methods use an iterative process with a machine learning algorithm to evaluate performance but do not always provide the best subset.
Feature importance methods use an ML model such as SVR or LARS to provide the best subset.

#YES - Embedded methods, such as Lasso and Ridge Regression, are regularization methods that extract features that contribute the most during a given iteration and provide the best subset dependent on the penalty parameter.
That's right! Embedded methods perform an iterative process to carefully extract important features to come up with the best subset based on the value of the penalty parameter alpha!
