Classification model features
You want to build a classification model that predicts whether a bank loan application should be either approved or denied. What features should be used to train a simple classifier?


Select the answer that is true:
All available features should be used to build the best model since the more information the model has, the more accurate it is.
Only the original features that have the highest correlation with the target variable should be used.
Linear regression can be used for training a baseline classifier composed of the features that show the highest correlation with the target variable.

# YES - Additional features should be created with feature engineering and they should be used along with the original features that have the highest correlation with the target variable.
Exactly! But you also have to be careful to remove the original features from the model if they are used in feature engineering so that there isn't correlation among the original and engineered features!
