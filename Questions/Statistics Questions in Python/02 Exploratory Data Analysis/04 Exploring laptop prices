Exploring laptop prices
We walked through an example in the video of surface-level data analysis of categorical variables. Here, you'll perform a similar task first-hand. Taken from the same pre-loaded laptops dataset, you'll work with three separate brands: Acer, Asus, and Toshiba.
You'll produce some initial information about the dataset, create a countplot of the companies, and analyze the relationship of each against the price in euros.
All of the usual packages have been imported for you. We've also gone ahead and imported the seaborn package as sns for you, which we'll use for visualization.



Get some initial information about the data using the info() function; here you can see the null values and data types quite easily.
# Get some initial info about the data
laptops.info()

<script.py> output:
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 309 entries, 0 to 308
    Data columns (total 3 columns):
    Company    309 non-null object
    Product    309 non-null object
    Price      309 non-null float64
    dtypes: float64(1), object(2)
    memory usage: 7.3+ KB






Visualize how many observations are from each brand by using the countplot() function on the Company column; examine the results.
# Produce a countplot of companies
sns.countplot(laptops['Company'])
plt.show()





Plot the relationship between the Price and Company columns; what can you conclude from this?
# Visualize the relationship with price
laptops.boxplot('Price', 'Company', rot=30)
plt.show()



What did you conclude here? It appears that Asus is the most common brand while Toshiba is less common. Furthermore, despite a few outliers, there is a steady increase in price as we move from Acer to Asus to Toshiba models. During your interview prep, don't forget to emphasize communicating results. Companies are looking for someone that can break down insights and share them effectively with non-technical team members. Recording yourself is an excellent way to practice this.
