Sensitivity to outliers
When we are analyzing the relationship of more than one variable, correlation is a great start. But how does correlation hold up against some more interesting datasets? How well does it hold up against outliers?
In this exercise, you will plot and compute the correlation for a dataset with an outlier and then remove it and see what changes. In the end, you want to see how correlation performs and come to a conclusion about when and where you should use it.
A sample dataset from the famous Anscombe's quartet has been imported for you as the df variable, along with the all the packages used previously in this chapter.

Display a matplotlib scatter plot of the X and Y features; notice the outlier in the top right.
# Display the scatter plot of X and Y
plt.scatter(df['X'], df['Y'])
plt.show()



Compute and print the Pearson correlation for the X and Y columns using the built-in corr() function within the pandas package.
In [2]: df['X']
Out[2]: 
0     10.0
1      8.0
2     13.0
3      9.0
4     11.0
5     14.0
6      6.0
7      4.0
8     12.0
9      7.0
10     5.0
Name: X, dtype: float64

In [3]: df['Y']
Out[3]: 
0      7.46
1      6.77
2     12.74
3      7.11
4      7.81
5      8.84
6      6.08
7      5.39
8      8.15
9      6.42
10     5.73
Name: Y, dtype: float64



# Compute and print the correlation
corr  = df['X'].corr(df['Y'])
print(corr)

<script.py> output:
    0.8162867394895984






Drop the outlier at index 2 from our dataset using the drop() function; assign and print the correlation again.
# Drop the outlier from the dataset
df = df.drop(2)

# Compute and print the correlation once more
new_corr  = df['X'].corr(df['Y'])
print(new_corr)

<script.py> output:
    0.9999965537848281
    
Great! Notice how our correlation initially suffered due to the outlier, but became nearly perfect once it was removed. This effectively conveyed the biggest complaint about Pearson correlation; the metric is not very robust to outliers, so data scientists often must seek other tools when the outliers can't or shouldn't be easily removed. It's a good idea to think about the pros and cons of techniques to stand out during your interview!
