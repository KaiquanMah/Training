Types of relationships
How do we effectively identify these relationships in practice? The first and often only step you need, is to visualize the data using a scatter plot. In this exercise, you'll examine a few different relationships, produce the scatter plot, and then consider what each plot tells us about the relationship.
You'll work with a few different features in the Australian weather dataset from before, imported as weather for you to use. For the sake of this exercise, make sure you pass features in the order they are given to you!

Visualize the relationship between the MinTemp and MaxTemp variables using the scatter() function.
# Display a scatter plot and examine the relationship
plt.scatter(weather['MinTemp'], weather['MaxTemp'])
plt.show()



Adapt your code to visualize the relationship between the MaxTemp and Humidity9am variables instead.
# Display a scatter plot and examine the relationship
plt.scatter(weather['MaxTemp'], weather['Humidity9am'])
plt.show()


Lastly, adapt your code once again for MinTemp and Humidity3pm variables.
# Display a scatter plot and examine the relationship
plt.scatter(weather['MinTemp'], weather['Humidity3pm'])
plt.show()


Good job! What did you conclude for each example? The first example gave us a decently strong positive relationship, the second example was about as strong but negative, and the final example had no apparent relationship. Understanding all of these terms is important, but make sure you understand what they mean in practice. In our first example, we saw that minimum temperature gave us some information about what the maximum temperature will be later on.
