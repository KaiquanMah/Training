Effect on type II error
Which component discussed earlier is the probability of a Type II error related to?

Sample size
Confidence level
Minimum effect size

#yes - All of the above
Correct! Sample size and confidence level are negatively correlated with Type II error, 
while minimum effect size causes a higher chance of Type II error. 
All of these are fair game for interviewers to test you on multiple concepts at once, so be ready!
