Applying confidence intervals
In practice, you aren't going to hand-code confidence intervals. Let's utilize the statsmodels package to streamline this process and examine some more tendencies of interval estimates.
In this exercise, we've generated a binomial sample of the number of heads in 50 fair coin flips saved as the heads variable. You'll compute a few different confidence intervals for this sample, and then scale your work for 10 similar samples.
The proportion_confint() function has already been imported to help you compute confidence intervals.


Compute and print a 99% confidence interval for 50 trials; does it contain the true proportion of a fair coin flip?
In [1]: heads
Out[1]: 27

# Compute and print the 99% confidence interval
confidence_int = proportion_confint(heads, 50, 0.01)
print(confidence_int)

<script.py> output:
    (0.35844514241179504, 0.721554857588205)









Adapt your code to generate a 90% confidence interval this time; does it contain the true proportion this time?
# Compute and print the 90% confidence interval
confidence_int = proportion_confint(heads, 50, 0.1)
print(confidence_int)

<script.py> output:
    (0.42406406993539053, 0.6559359300646095)








Repeat this process of sampling, computing the confidence interval, and printing the result 10 times using a loop.
# Repeat this process 10 times 
# binom.rvs(# flips per trial,
#           % success.
#           # repeated trials)
heads = binom.rvs(50, 0.5, size=10)
for val in heads:
    confidence_interval = proportion_confint(val, 50, .10)
    print(confidence_interval)



<script.py> output:
    (0.3440640699353905, 0.5759359300646095)
    (0.3245317440082245, 0.5554682559917755)
    (0.3836912846323326, 0.6163087153676674)
    (0.42406406993539053, 0.6559359300646095)
    (0.36378436885322046, 0.5962156311467796)
    (0.5283436332470393, 0.7516563667529608)
    (0.42406406993539053, 0.6559359300646095)
    (0.3836912846323326, 0.6163087153676674)
    (0.36378436885322046, 0.5962156311467796)
    (0.36378436885322046, 0.5962156311467796)
    
    
    
Examine your confidence interval results from the last step. You might see at least one confidence interval that does not contain 0.5, the true population proportion for a fair coin flip. You could decrease the likelihood of this happening by increasing your confidence level or lowering the alpha value.
