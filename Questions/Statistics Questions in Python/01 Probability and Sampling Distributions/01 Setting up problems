Setting up problems
You're testing for a disease and advertising that the test is 99% accurate; 
that is if you have the disease, you will test positive 99% of the time, and 
if you don't have the disease, you will test negative 99% of the time. 
Let's say that 1% of all people have the disease and someone tests positive. 
What's the probability that the person has the disease? 



P(test pos|have) = P(have|test pos) x P (test pos)
                    /P(have)

P(have|test pos) = .01
P(test pos) = .99
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem
P(have) = P(have|test pos) x P(test pos)  +   P(dont have|test neg) x P(test neg)
        = .01 x .99                      +   .99 x <take as .01>

Select the correct set up for this problem.
.99 × .01 / (.01)
.99 × .99 / (.01 × .99)
(.01 × .99) + (.99 × .01) / (.99 × .01)
 
#yes - .99 × .01 / (.01 × .99)+(.99 × .01)
Correct! If you follow through with this computation, you get the result that our patient has a 50% probability of having the disease, given that they tested positive. If this didn't make complete sense, be sure to brush up on Bayes' theorem a bit!
