Fixing string errors in a DataFrame
You are given the heroes dataset containing the information on different comic book heroes. However, you'll need to make some refinements in order to use this dataset further.
Comparing Eye color, Hair color, and Skin color columns, you can see that strings in the Hair color columns are capitalized, whereas in other two the strings are lowercased.
Moreover, some rows in the Gender column contain a spelling error (Fmale instead of Female).
Your task is to make the strings in the Hair column lowercased and to fix the spelling error in the Gender column.


Make all the values in the Hair color column lowercased.
