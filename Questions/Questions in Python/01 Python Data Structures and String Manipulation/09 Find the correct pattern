Find the correct pattern
You visit a website and it asks you to fill in a registration form. The username section requires you to choose a name between 3 and 16 characters long. It can only include alphanumeric characters (no capital letters), hyphens, and underscores. Which of the following patterns will your input be matched against?
The symbols ^ and $ were not discussed in the video lecture: they simply indicate the beginning and end of a line (in this case, the beginning and end of the chosen username).
The module re is already imported for you.


^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,16}$
^[a-z0-9_-]{3,17}$
^[a-z0-9_]{3,16}$

#YES - ^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$
Correct. This is the pattern your input will be matched against.
