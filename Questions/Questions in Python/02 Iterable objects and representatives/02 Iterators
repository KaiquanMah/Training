Iterators
Let's check your knowledge on Iterators!
As we discussed, all Iterables like list, set, or dict must have the associated Iterator. You are given the dictionary pets whose keys are Harry Potter characters and the values are the corresponding creature companions they had. Your task is to answer the set of questions regarding the Iterator created from the pets dictionary. Use the console to help you answer them!
Pro tip: to break a line in the IPython Shell (not the script.py section), use Shift + Enter.



What would be the second element of the Iterator created from the pets dictionary?
{'Harry': 'Hedwig the owl', 'Hermione': 'Crookshanks the cat', 'Ron': 'Scabbers the rat'}

'Harry'
'Hedwig the owl'
'Crookshanks the cat'

#YES - 'Hermione'





Assuming that you retrieved the Iterator from the pets dictionary and called the next() function on it twice, what will be the output when you convert the Iterator to a list?
[]
StopIteration error is raised
['Hermione', 'Ron']
['Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron']

# yes - ['Ron']








Assuming that you retrieved the Iterator from the pets dictionary and converted it to a list, what will be the output if you call the next() function on it?
'Ron'
'Hermione'
'Harry'

#yes - StopIteration error is raised
Correct! The Iterator does not contain any more elements to go through after converting it to a list.
