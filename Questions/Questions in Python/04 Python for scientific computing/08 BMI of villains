BMI of villains
Let's return to the heroes dataset containing the information on different comic book heroes. We added a bmi column to the dataset calculated as Weight divided by (Height/100)**2. This index helps define whether an individual has weight problems.
Your task is to find out what is the mean value and standard deviation of the BMI index depending on the character's 'Alignment' and the 'Publisher' whom this character belongs to. However, you'll need to consider only those groups that have more than 10 valid observations of the BMI index.
Tip: use .count() to calculate the number of valid observations.



Group the data by the two factors specified above.
Filter groups having more than 10 valid bmi observations.
Group the filtered data again by the same factors.
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the BMI index.

#attempt 1
import numpy as np

# Group the data by two factors specified in the context
groups = heroes.groupby(['Alignment', 'Publisher'])

# Filter groups having more than 10 valid bmi observations
fheroes = (groups.count()>10)

# Group the filtered data again by the same factors
fgroups = fheroes.groupby(['Alignment', 'Publisher'])

# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the BMI index
result = fgroups['bmi'].agg([np.mean, np.std])
print(result)













#2nd attempt
import numpy as np

# Group the data by two factors specified in the context
groups = heroes.groupby(['Publisher', 'Alignment'])

# Filter groups having more than 10 valid bmi observations
fheroes = groups.filter(lambda x: x['bmi'].count() > 10)

Magnificent! Interestingly, villains have quite a big BMI index in average (an individual is considered overweight when it is > 30), with a considerable standard deviation. Good characters are pretty normal (BMI index between 25 and 30 is considered normal).
