Creating boxplots
Let's get back to our heroes dataset. As we previously discovered, the BMI index is in average much higher for villains than for good characters (taking into account only Marvel and DC publishers). Your task is to plot the corresponding distributions of BMI indices using boxplots.
Tip: to select rows in a DataFrame, for which a specific column follows a certain condition, use this expression dataframe[condition for column_name] (e.g. heroes[heroes['Alignment'] == 'good'] selects rows that have a 'good' Alignment in the heroes dataset).

Create a boxplot of BMI indices for good and bad sides.
import seaborn as sns

# Create a boxplot of BMI indices for 'good' and 'bad' sides
sns.boxplot('Alignment', 'bmi', data=heroes)
plt.show()




Select rows from heroes for which the BMI index is smaller than 1000.
# Select rows from 'heroes' for which the BMI index < 1000
heroes_filtered = heroes[heroes['bmi'] < 1000]







Create a new boxplot of BMI indices for good and bad sides using heroes_filtered.
import seaborn as sns

# Select rows from 'heroes' for which the BMI index < 1000
heroes_filtered = heroes[heroes['bmi'] < 1000]

# Create a new boxplot of BMI indices
sns.boxplot('Alignment','bmi',data=heroes_filtered)
plt.show()


Very good job! You saw that there are two outliers (Giganta and Utgard-Loki from Marvel comics) which affect the average value of BMI index for villains. If you filter them out, the villains are only slightly higher in their values of BMI index.
