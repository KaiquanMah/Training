Functions with additional arguments
Let's add some arguments to the function definition!

Numeric data in scores represent students' performance scaled between 0 and 100. Your task is to rescale this data to an arbitrary range between low and high. Rescaling should be done in a linear fashion, i.e. for any data point x in a column:

x(new) = x(highâˆ’low/100) + low
To do rescaling, you'll have to define the function rescale(). Remember, the operation written above can be applied to Series directly. After defining the function, you'll have to apply it to the specified columns of scores.



Define the expression to rescale input series.
Rescale the data in cols to lie between 1 and 10.

#attempt 1
def rescale(series, low, high):
   # Define the expression to rescale input series
   return (high-low)/100+low

# Rescale the data in cols to lie between 1 and 10
cols = ['math score', 'reading score', 'writing score'] 
scores[cols] = scores[cols].apply(rescale, args=[cols, 1, 10])
print(scores[cols].head())








#attempt 2
def rescale(series, low, high):
   # Define the expression to rescale input series
   return series * (high - low)/100 + low

# Rescale the data in cols to lie between 1 and 10
cols = ['math score', 'reading score', 'writing score'] 
scores[cols] = scores[cols].apply(rescale, args=[1, 10])
print(scores[cols].head())


<script.py> output:
       math score  reading score  writing score
    0        7.66           8.74           8.38
    1        4.96           5.41           5.77
    2        5.86           5.14           4.87
    3        8.92           9.55           9.28
    4        8.65           8.29           8.29












Redefine the function to accept keyword arguments with 0 and 100 as the default lower and upper limit, respectively.
Rescale the data in cols to lie between 1 and 10.

# Redefine the function to accept keyword arguments
def rescale(series, low=0, high=100):
   return series * (high - low)/100 + low

# Rescale the data in cols to lie between 1 and 10
cols = ['math score', 'reading score', 'writing score']
scores[cols] = scores[cols].apply(rescale, args=[1, 10])
print(scores[cols].head())



<script.py> output:
       math score  reading score  writing score
    0        7.66           8.74           8.38
    1        4.96           5.41           5.77
    2        5.86           5.14           4.87
