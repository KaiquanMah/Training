Incorrect array initialization
If you pass the following list [1, (2, 3), 4] to initialize a NumPy array, what would be the data type of the stored values?
The module numpy is already imported for you as np.


int64
float64
<U1

#YES - object
Correct. Since we have different data types in our list, all the elements are considered as an object.
