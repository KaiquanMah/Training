Explore feature relationships
Let's do some exploratory analysis. You are already familiar with the retinol dataset. It stores the information on the relationship between different factors (background information, clinical data) and the levels of retinol (plasma retinol) and beta-carotene (plasma B-carotene) in blood plasma. Low levels of these compounds were reported to be associated with higher risk of cancer.


Which numeric features may have strong linear relationship to the plasma retinol feature?
The matplotlib.pyplot module is already imported as plt.

age
bmi, calories, fat, and cholesterol
diet retinol and diet B-carotene
plasma B-carotene

#YES - neither of the numeric features
Correct. Neither of the numeric features show strong linear relationship with plasma retinol. This question serves as an example that interviewers might try to confuse you by making you try to find some regularity in the data, which is deliberately absent.
