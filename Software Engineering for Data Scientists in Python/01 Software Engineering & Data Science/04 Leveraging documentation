Leveraging documentation
When writing code for Data Science, it's inevitable that you'll need to install and use someone else's code. You'll quickly learn that using someone else's code is much more pleasant when they use good software engineering practices. In particular, good documentation makes the right way to call a function obvious. In this exercise you'll use python's help() method to view a function's documentation so you can determine how to correctly call a new method.

View the documentation of the Counter.most_common method using the help() function. Note, you need to run the import statement before completing this step.
# load the Counter function into our environment
from collections import Counter

# View the documentation for Counter.most_common
help(Counter.most_common)


<script.py> output:
    Help on function most_common in module collections:
    
    most_common(self, n=None)
        List the n most common elements and their counts from the most
        common to the least.  If n is None, then list all element counts.
        
        >>> Counter('abcdeabcdabcaba').most_common(3)
        [('a', 5), ('b', 4), ('c', 3)]








Correctly call Counter.most_common() by reading its documentation.
Print the results stored in top_5_words.

# load the Counter function into our environment
from collections import Counter

# View the documentation for Counter.most_common
help(Counter.most_common)

# use Counter to find the top 5 most common words
top_5_words = Counter(words).most_common(5)

# display the top 5 most common words
print(top_5_words)


<script.py> output:
    Help on function most_common in module collections:
    
    most_common(self, n=None)
        List the n most common elements and their counts from the most
        common to the least.  If n is None, then list all element counts.
        
        >>> Counter('abcdeabcdabcaba').most_common(3)
        [('a', 5), ('b', 4), ('c', 3)]
    
    [('@DataCamp', 299), ('to', 263), ('the', 251), ('in', 164), ('RT', 158)]




Great work! Good documentation lets users like you and me easily figure out how to use new functions.
