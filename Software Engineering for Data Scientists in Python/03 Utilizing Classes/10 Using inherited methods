Using inherited methods
You've now defined a Tweets class that's inherited methods from both Document and SocialMedia. In this exercise, you'll use inherited methods to visualize text from both tweets and retweets.
Be aware that this is real data from Twitter and as such there is always a risk that it may contain profanity or other offensive content (in this exercise, and any following exercises that also use real Twitter data).


import your text_analyzer package.
Define my_tweets as an instance of Tweets using the datacamp_tweets data that has been pre-loaded into your environment.
# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)








Use the plot_counts() method to plot the top 'hashtag_counts'.
Make sure to check the documentation for my_tweets.plot_counts.

In [3]: help(my_tweets.plot_counts)
Help on method plot_counts in module text_analyzer.document:

plot_counts(attribute='word_counts', n_most_common=5) method of text_analyzer.tweets.Tweets instance
    Plot most common elements of a ``collections.Counter`` instance attribute
    
    :param attribute: name of ``Counter`` attribute to use as object to plot
    :param n_most_common: number of elements to plot (using ``Counter.most_common()``)
    :return: None; a plot is shown using matplotlib
    
    >>> doc = Document("duck duck goose is fun when you're the goose")
    >>> doc.plot_counts('word_counts', n_most_common=5)  # same as default call





# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)


# Plot the most used hashtags in the tweets
my_tweets.plot_counts('hashtag_counts')











Use the plot_counts() method of the retweets attribute to plot the most used hashtags in the retweets subset of the data.

# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)

# Plot the most used hashtags in the retweets
my_tweets.retweets.plot_counts('hashtag_counts')

Great work! Your Tweets class can easily visualize Twitter data with little code thanks to inheritance and clever usage of classes.
