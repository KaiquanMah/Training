Naming packages
We covered the PEP 8 guidelines for naming packages. In this exercise, you'll use that knowledge to identify a package following the requirements.
For additional reference, you can view the PEP 8 section on package naming here
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-name



The possible package names to import are the following: text_analyzer, textAnalyzer, TextAnalyzer, & __text_analyzer__.
import the package from the list above that follows the PEP 8 naming conventions.

# Import the package with a name that follows PEP 8
import text_analyzer

Great job! PEP 8 instructs that package names be all lowercase and only use underscores when it improves readability.
