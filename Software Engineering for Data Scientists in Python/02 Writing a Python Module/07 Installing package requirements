Installing package requirements
You've now written a requirements.txt file to recreate your package's environment using a pip install command. Given that you are running a shell session in the work_dir structure shown below, what command would properly recreate the my_package environment from requirements.txt?

work_dir/
├── my_package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── utils.py
├── requirements.txt
└── setup.py


pip install requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements
pip install -r setup.py

#YES - pip install -r requirements.txt
Correct! pip install -r allows you to install everything listed in a requirements file.
