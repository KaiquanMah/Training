================================================
Instructions
If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.

Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":
CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
)

Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:
DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Willum', 39);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ryley', 39);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Mueez', 17);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Wynn', 29);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Marian', 13);

Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:
SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X

Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.
Note: This assignment must be done using SQLite - in particular, the SELECT query above will not work in any other database. So you cannot use MySQL or Oracle for this assignment.
