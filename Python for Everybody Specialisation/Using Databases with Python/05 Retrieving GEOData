Retrieving GEOData
Download the code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip - then unzip the file and 
edit where.data to add an address nearby where you live - don't reveal where you live. 

Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. 
Then run geodump.py to read the database and produce where.js. 
You can run the programs and then scroll back to take your screen shots when the program finishes. 

Then open where.html to visualize the map. 
Take screen shots as described below. Make sure that your added location shows in all three of your screen shots.
This is a relatively simple assignment. Don't take off points for little mistakes. If they seem to have done the assignment give them full credit. Feel free to make suggestions if there are small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful. If you do not take grading seriously, the instructors may delete your response and you will lose points.
