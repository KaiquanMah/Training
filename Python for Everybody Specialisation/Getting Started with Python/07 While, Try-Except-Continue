5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.


largest = None
smallest = None

while True:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    if num == "done":
        break
    
    try:
        num = int(num)
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue
	
    if (smallest == None) or (largest == None):
    	smallest = num
        largest = num
    if (num > largest) :    
        largest = num
    elif (num < smallest):
        smallest = num
    

print("Maximum is", largest)
print("Minimum is", smallest)


Invalid input
Maximum is 10
Minimum is 2
