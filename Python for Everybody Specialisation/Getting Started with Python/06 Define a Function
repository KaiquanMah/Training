4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.

def computepay(h, r):
    
    if h>40:
        p = (40 * r) + (h-40)*1.5*r
    else:
        p = h * r
    
    return p    
    

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
hrs = float(hrs)
r = input("Enter Rate:")
r = float(r)

p = computepay(hrs, r)
print("Pay", p)
