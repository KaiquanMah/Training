2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
# This first line is provided for you

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
rate = input("Enter Rate Per Hour:")
pay = float(hrs) * float(rate)
print("Pay:", pay)


Pay: 96.25
