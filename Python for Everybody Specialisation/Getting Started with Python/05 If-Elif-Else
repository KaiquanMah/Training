3.3 Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.



score = input("Enter Score: ")
score = float(score)

if score >1.0:
    grade = "invalid"
elif score >= 0.9:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 0.8:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 0.7:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 0.6:
    grade = "D"
elif (score < 0.6) and (score >= 0.0):
    grade = "F"
else:
    grade = "invalid"
    
print(grade)
