Build failing
In the GitHub repository of a Python package, you see the following badge:
What can you, as a user, conclude from this badge?

There are no unit tests in the package.
The package has a code coverage less than 75%.
There's no .travis.yml configuration file at the root of the repository.

#YES - The package has bugs, which is either causing installation to error out or some of the unit tests in the test suite to fail.
That's correct! Since a build failing badge is indicative of bugs, the maintainer of any package should strive to keep this badge green ("passing").
