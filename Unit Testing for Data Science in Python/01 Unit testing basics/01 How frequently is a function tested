How frequently is a function tested?
Many data scientists do not think much about testing, and just do it in the manual way when necessary. But once you see the big picture i.e. the life cycle of a function over the entire project, you appreciate how important testing really is and how frequently you need to test things.


Which of the following is true about testing?
A function is tested just once during its life cycle, which is right after the first implementation.
A function is tested after the first implementation and then any time the function is modified, and this happens mainly when new bugs are found.
A function is tested every time the function is executed.

#YES - A function is tested after the first implementation and then any time the function is modified, which happens mainly when new bugs are found, new features are implemented or the code is refactored.
Exactly! If the project goes on for a few years, you may end up testing the same function over a hundred times because of new bugs, new feature requests and refactoring!
