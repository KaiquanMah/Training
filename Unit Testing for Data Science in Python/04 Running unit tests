Running unit tests
The tests that you wrote in the previous exercise have been written to a test module test_convert_to_int.py. Try running the tests in the IPython console.
What is the correct IPython console command to run the tests in this test module?


pytest test_convert_to_int.py
pytest
!pytest

#YES - !pytest test_convert_to_int.py
Congratulations! You just wrote and ran your first unit test. You probably saw that running the test produced a lot of output. This output contains information about a bug in convert_to_int(). You should be able to read and understand this output in order to bug fix efficiently. This will be covered in the next video lesson. Jump right in!
