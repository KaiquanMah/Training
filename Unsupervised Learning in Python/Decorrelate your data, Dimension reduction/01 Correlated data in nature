#You are given an array grains giving the width and length of samples of grain. You suspect that width and length will be correlated. To confirm this, make a scatter plot of width vs length and measure their Pearson correlation.

#Import:
#matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
#pearsonr from scipy.stats
# Perform the necessary imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# Assign the 0th column of grains: width
width = grains[:,0]

# Assign the 1st column of grains: length
length = grains[:,1]

# Scatter plot width vs length
plt.scatter(width, length)
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()

# Calculate the Pearson correlation
correlation, pvalue = pearsonr(width, length)

# Display the correlation
print(correlation)

#0.860414937714
#Great work! As you would expect, the width and length of the grain samples are highly correlated.
