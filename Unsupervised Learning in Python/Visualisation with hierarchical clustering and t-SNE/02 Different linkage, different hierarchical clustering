#Which clusters are closest?
#In the video, you learned that the linkage method defines how the distance between clusters is measured. In complete linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the furthest points of the clusters. In single linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the closest points of the clusters.
#Consider the three clusters in the diagram. Which of the following statements are true?
#A. In single linkage, cluster 3 is the closest to cluster 2.
#B. In complete linkage, cluster 1 is the closest to cluster 2.

#Both A and B.



#part 2
#02 Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering
#In the video, you saw a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries at the Eurovision song contest using 'complete' linkage. Now, perform a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries with 'single' linkage, and compare the resulting dendrogram with the one in the video. Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering!
#You are given an array samples. Each row corresponds to a voting country, and each column corresponds to a performance that was voted for. The list country_names gives the name of each voting country. This dataset was obtained from Eurovision.

# Perform the necessary imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram

#Perform hierarchical clustering on samples using the linkage() function with the method='single' keyword argument. Assign the result to mergings.
# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(samples, method='single')

#Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list country_names as the labels. In addition, specify the leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6 keyword arguments as you have done earlier.
# Plot the dendrogram
dendrogram(mergings, labels=country_names,leaf_rotation=90, leaf_font_size=6)
plt.show()

#As you can see, performing single linkage hierarchical clustering produces a different dendrogram!



#part 3
#Intermediate clusterings
#Displayed on the right is the dendrogram for the hierarchical clustering of the grain samples that you computed earlier. If the hierarchical clustering were stopped at height 6 on the dendrogram, how many clusters would there be?
