#Recommend musical artists part I
#In this exercise and the next, you'll use what you've learned about NMF to recommend popular music artists! You are given a sparse array artists whose rows correspond to artists and whose column correspond to users. The entries give the number of times each artist was listened to by each user.
#In this exercise, build a pipeline and transform the array into normalized NMF features. The first step in the pipeline, MaxAbsScaler, transforms the data so that all users have the same influence on the model, regardless of how many different artists they've listened to. In the next exercise, you'll use the resulting normalized NMF features for recommendation!
#This data is part of a larger dataset available here.


# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer, MaxAbsScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Create a MaxAbsScaler: scaler
scaler = MaxAbsScaler()

#Create an NMF instance with 20 components called nmf.
# Create an NMF model: nmf
nmf = NMF(n_components=20)

# Create a Normalizer: normalizer
normalizer = Normalizer()

#Create a pipeline called pipeline that chains together scaler, nmf, and normalizer.
# Create a pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(scaler, nmf, normalizer)

# Apply fit_transform to artists: norm_features
norm_features = pipeline.fit_transform(artists)

#Excellent work - now that you've computed the normalized NMF features, you'll use them in the next exercise to recommend musical artists!



#part 2
#Recommend musical artists part II
#Suppose you were a big fan of Bruce Springsteen - which other musicial artists might you like? Use your NMF features from the previous exercise and the cosine similarity to find similar musical artists. A solution to the previous exercise has been run, so norm_features is an array containing the normalized NMF features as rows. The names of the musical artists are available as the list artist_names.


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

#Create a DataFrame df from norm_features, using artist_names as an index.
# Create a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(norm_features, index=artist_names)

#Use the .loc[] accessor of df to select the row of 'Bruce Springsteen'. Assign the result to artist.
# Select row of 'Bruce Springsteen': artist
artist = df.loc['Bruce Springsteen']
