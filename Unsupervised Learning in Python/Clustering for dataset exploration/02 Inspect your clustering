#Let's now inspect the clustering you performed in the previous exercise!
#A solution to the previous exercise has already run, so new_points is an array of points and labels is the array of their cluster labels.


# Import pyplot
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

#Assign column 0 of new_points to xs, and column 1 of new_points to ys.
# Assign the columns of new_points: xs and ys
xs = new_points[:,0]
ys = new_points[:,1]

#Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, specifying the c=labels keyword arguments to color the points by their cluster label. Also specify alpha=0.5.
# Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, using labels to define the colors
plt.scatter(xs, ys, c=labels, alpha=0.5)

#Compute the coordinates of the centroids using the .cluster_centers_ attribute of model.
# Assign the cluster centers: centroids
centroids = model.cluster_centers_

#Assign column 0 of centroids to centroids_x, and column 1 of centroids to centroids_y.
# Assign the columns of centroids: centroids_x, centroids_y
centroids_x = centroids[:,0]
centroids_y = centroids[:,1]

#Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y, using 'D' (a diamond) as a marker by specifying the marker parameter. Set the size of the markers to be 50 using s=50.
# Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y
plt.scatter(centroids_x, centroids_y, marker='D', s=50)
plt.show()

#The clustering looks great! But how can you be sure that 3 clusters is the correct choice? In other words, how can you evaluate the quality of a clustering? Tune into the next video in which Ben will explain how to evaluate a clustering!
