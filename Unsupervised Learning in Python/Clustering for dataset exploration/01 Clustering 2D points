#How many clusters?
#You are given an array points of size 300x2, where each row gives the (x, y) co-ordinates of a point on a map. Make a scatter plot of these points, and use the scatter plot to guess how many clusters there are.


#matplotlib.pyplot has already been imported as plt. In the IPython Shell:
#Create an array called xs that contains the values of points[:,0] - that is, column 0 of points.
xs= pd.DataFrame(points[:,0])

#Create an array called ys that contains the values of points[:,1] - that is, column 1 of points.
ys= pd.DataFrame(points[:,1])

#Make a scatter plot by passing xs and ys to the plt.scatter() function.
plt.scatter(xs, ys)

#Call the plt.show() function to show your plot.
plt.show()

#How many clusters do you see?
#3



#part2
#Clustering 2D points
#From the scatter plot of the previous exercise, you saw that the points seem to separate into 3 clusters. You'll now create a KMeans model to find 3 clusters, and fit it to the data points from the previous exercise. After the model has been fit, you'll obtain the cluster labels for some new points using the .predict() method.
#You are given the array points from the previous exercise, and also an array new_points.

#Import KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
# Import KMeans
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

#Using KMeans(), create a KMeans instance called model to find 3 clusters. To specify the number of clusters, use the n_clusters keyword argument.
# Create a KMeans instance with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters = 3)

#Use the .fit() method of model to fit the model to the array of points "points".
# Fit model to points
model.fit(points)

#Use the .predict() method of model to predict the cluster labels of new_points, assigning the result to labels.
# Determine the cluster labels of new_points: labels
labels = model.predict(new_points)

# Print cluster labels of new_points
print(labels)


#You've successfully performed k-Means clustering and predicted the labels of new points. But it is not easy to inspect the clustering by just looking at the printed labels. A visualization would be far more useful. In the next exercise, you'll inspect your clustering with a scatter plot!
