Portfolio standard deviation
In order to calculate portfolio volatility, you will need the covariance matrix, the portfolio weights, and knowledge of the transpose operation. The transpose of a numpy array can be calculated using the .T attribute. The np.dot() function is the dot-product of two arrays.

The formula for portfolio volatility is:

σPortfolio = np.sqrt (wT ⋅ Σ ⋅ w)

σPortfolio: Portfolio volatility
Σ: Covariance matrix of returns
w: Portfolio weights (wT is transposed portfolio weights)
⋅  The dot-multiplication operator

portfolio_weights and cov_mat_annual are available in your workspace.




# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Calculate the portfolio standard deviation
portfolio_volatility = np.sqrt(np.dot(portfolio_weights.T, np.dot(cov_mat_annual, portfolio_weights)))
print(portfolio_volatility)


<script.py> output:
    0.08931417642713807
    
The portfolio volatility is 8.93%
