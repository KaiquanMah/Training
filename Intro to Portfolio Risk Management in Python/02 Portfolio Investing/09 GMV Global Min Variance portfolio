The GMV portfolio
The global minimum volatility portfolio, or GMV portfolio, is the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation (risk) and the highest return for the given risk level.

Returns are very hard to predict, but volatilities and correlations tend to be more stable over time. This means that the GMV portfolio often outperforms the MSR portfolios out of sample even though the MSR would outperform quite significantly in-sample. Of course, out of sample results are what really matters in finance.

#Sort RandomPortfolios with the lowest volatility value, ranking in ascending order.
# Sort the portfolios by volatility
sorted_portfolios = RandomPortfolios.sort_values(by=['Volatility'], ascending=True)

# Extract the corresponding weights
GMV_weights = sorted_portfolios.iloc[0, 0:numstocks]

# Cast the GMV weights as a numpy array
GMV_weights_array = np.array(GMV_weights)



#Multiply GMV_weights_array across the rows of StockReturns to get weighted stock returns.
# Calculate the GMV portfolio returns
StockReturns['Portfolio_GMV'] = StockReturns.iloc[:, 0:numstocks].mul(GMV_weights_array, axis=1).sum(axis=1)



#Finally, review the plot of cumulative returns over time.
# Plot the cumulative returns
cumulative_returns_plot(['Portfolio_EW', 'Portfolio_MCap', 'Portfolio_MSR', 'Portfolio_GMV'])


The GMV portfolio tends to be the most stable optimization over time, but of course you can expect a lower volatility portfolio to have lower return than the benchmark market cap weighting method.
