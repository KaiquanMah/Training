Second moment: Variance
Just like you estimated the first moment of the returns distribution in the last exercise, you can can also estimate the second moment, or variance of a return distribution using numpy.

In this case, you will first need to calculate the daily standard deviation ( σ ), or volatility of the returns using np.std(). The variance is simply σ2.

StockPrices from the previous exercise is available in your workspace, and numpy is imported as np.


# Calculate the standard deviation of daily return of the stock
sigma_daily = np.std(StockPrices['Returns'])
print(sigma_daily)

<script.py> output:
    0.019341100408708317
    
    
# Calculate the daily variance
variance_daily = sigma_daily**2
print(variance_daily)

<script.py> output:
    0.00037407816501973704

The average daily volatility of the stock (sigma) is 1.93% per day. The average daily variance of the stock (the second moment) is 0.04%.

















Annualizing variance
You can't annualize the variance in the same way that you annualized the mean.

In this case, you will need to multiply σ by the square root of the number of trading days in a year. There are typically 252 trading days in a calendar year. Let's assume this is the case for this exercise.

This will get you the annualized volatility, but to get annualized variance, you'll need to square the annualized volatility just like you did for the daily calculation.

sigma_daily from the previous exercise is available in your workspace, and numpy is imported as np.



# Annualize the standard deviation
sigma_annualized = sigma_daily*np.sqrt(252)
print(sigma_annualized)


<script.py> output:
    0.3070304505826315
    
    
# Calculate the annualized variance
variance_annualized = sigma_annualized**2
print(variance_annualized)


<script.py> output:
    0.09426769758497373

This works out to an annualized volatility (sigma) of 30.7% per year. And an annualized variance of 9.43% per year
