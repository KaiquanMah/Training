Statistical tests for normality
In order to truly be confident in your judgement of the normality of the stock's return distribution, you will want to use a true statistical test rather than simply examining the kurtosis or skewness.

You can use the shapiro() function from scipy.stats to run a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the stock returns. The function will return two values in a list. The first value is the t-stat of the test, and the second value is the p-value. You can use the p-value to make a judgement about the normality of the data. If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, you can safely reject the null hypothesis of normality and assume that the data are non-normally distributed.

clean_returns from the previous exercise is available in your workspace.



# Import shapiro from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import shapiro

# Run the Shapiro-Wilk test on the stock returns
shapiro_results = shapiro(clean_returns)
print("Shapiro results:", shapiro_results)

<script.py> output:
    Shapiro results: (0.9003633260726929, 0.0)

# Extract the p-value from the shapiro_results
p_value = shapiro_results[1]
print("P-value: ", p_value)

<script.py> output:
    P-value:  0.0
The p-value is 0, so null hypothesis of normality is rejected. The data are non-normal.
