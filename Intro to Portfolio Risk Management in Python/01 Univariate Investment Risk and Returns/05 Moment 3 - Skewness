Third moment: Skewness
To calculate the third moment, or skewness of a returns distribution in Python, you can use the skew() function from scipy.stats.

Remember that a negative skew is a right-leaning curve, while positive skew is a left-leaning curve. In finance, you would tend to want positive skewness, as this would mean that the probability of large positive returns is unusually high, and the negative returns are more closely clustered and predictable.

StockPrices from the previous exercise is available in your workspace.





# Import skew from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import skew


#Drop missing values in the 'Returns' column to prevent errors.
# Drop the missing values
clean_returns = StockPrices["Returns"].dropna()

# Calculate the third moment (skewness) of the returns distribution
returns_skewness = skew(clean_returns)
print(returns_skewness)

<script.py> output:
    0.21935459193067852

The third moment (skewness) of the stock returns is 0.22. A normal distribution would have a skewness much closer to 0.
