Fourth moment: Kurtosis
Finally, to calculate the fourth moment of a distribution, you can use the kurtosis() function from scipy.stats.

Note that this function actually returns the excess kurtosis, not the 4th moment itself. In order to calculate kurtosis, simply add 3 to the excess kurtosis returned by kurtosis().

clean_returns from the previous exercise is available in your workspace.



# Import kurtosis from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import kurtosis



#Use clean_returns to calculate the excess_kurtosis.
# Calculate the excess kurtosis of the returns distribution
excess_kurtosis = kurtosis(clean_returns)
print(excess_kurtosis)

<script.py> output:
    10.31457261802553
    


# Derive the true fourth moment of the returns distribution
fourth_moment = excess_kurtosis
print(fourth_moment)

<script.py> output:
    13.31457261802553




The fourth moment (kurtosis) of the stock returns is 13.31 with an excess kurtosis of 10.31. A normal distribution would tend to have a kurtosis of 3, and an excess kurtosis of 0.
