The 5-factor model
In 2015, Fama and French extended their previous 3-factor model, adding two additional factors:
RMW: Profitability
CMA: Investment

The RMW factor represents the returns of companies with high operating profitability versus those with low operating profitability, and the CMA factor represents the returns of companies with aggressive investments versus those who are more conservative.

The FamaFrenchData object is available in your workspace and contains the RMW and CMA factors in addition to the previous factors.

# Import statsmodels.formula.api
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf 



#Use what you've learned from the previous exercises to define the FamaFrench5_model regression model for Portfolio_Excess against the original 3 Fama-French factors (Market_Excess, SMB, HML) in addition to the two new factors (RMW, CMA).
# Define the regression formula
FamaFrench5_model = smf.ols(formula='Portfolio_Excess ~ Market_Excess + SMB + HML + RMW + CMA ', data=FamaFrenchData)



#Fit the regression model and store the results in FamaFrench5_fit.
# Fit the regression
FamaFrench5_fit = FamaFrench5_model.fit()

# Extract the adjusted r-squared
regression_adj_rsq = FamaFrench5_fit.rsquared_adj
print(regression_adj_rsq)

<script.py> output:
    0.836724501922579
    

The adjusted r-squared is even higher at 0.8367! Could you build a better model?
























Alpha vs R-squared
The results of the 3 models you constructed are in line with Fama and French's findings, with the 5-factor model being superior at explaining portfolio returns.

Model	              Adjusted R-Squared
CAPM	                0.7943
Fama-French 3 Factor	0.8194
Fama-French 5 Factor	0.8367

Without examining the regression intercepts directly, what do these results tell you about the alpha estimated by each model?


#YES The Fama-French 5 Factor model explains the most variability, so alpha is lower
#Correct! But Cliff Assness says this model is not sufficient and that momentum should be taken into account.
