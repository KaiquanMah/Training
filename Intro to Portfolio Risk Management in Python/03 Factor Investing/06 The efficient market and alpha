The efficient market and alpha
The alpha (Î±) left over by the regression is unexplained performance due to unknown factors. In a regression model, this is simply the coefficient of the intercept.

There are two general schools of thought as to why:
1 EMH - The model simply needs to be expanded. When you have found all of the missing economic factors, you can explain all stock and portfolio returns. This is known as the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
2 Some unexplainability - There is a degree of unexplainable performance that no model will ever capture reliably. Perhaps it is due to skill, timing, intuition or luck, but investors should seek to maximize their alpha.

Your annualized portfolio alpha is 4.73% -- Efficient markets beware!
