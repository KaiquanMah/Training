Calculating beta with CAPM
There are many ways to model stock returns, but the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM, is one the most well known:

E(RP) − RF = βP (E(RM)−RF) 

E(RP)−RF: The excess expected return of a stock or portfolio P
E(RM)−RF: The excess expected return of the broad market portfolio B
RF: The regional risk free-rate
βP: Portfolio beta, or exposure, to the broad market portfolio B


You can call the .fit() method from statsmodels.formula.api on an .ols(formula, data) model object to perform the analysis, and the .summary() method on the analysis object to anaylze the results.

The FamaFrenchData DataFrame is available in your workspace and contains the proper data for this exercise.




CAPM_fit.params
Intercept        0.000216
Market_Excess    0.973776
dtype: float64







#First, you will need to import statsmodels.formula.api as smf.
# Import statsmodels.formula.api
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf 



#Define a regression model that explains Portfolio_Excess as a function of Market_Excess.
# Define the regression formula
CAPM_model = smf.ols(formula='Portfolio_Excess ~ Market_Excess', data=FamaFrenchData)




#Extract and print the adjusted r-squared of the fitted regression model.
# Print adjusted r-squared of the fitted regression
CAPM_fit = CAPM_model.fit()
print(CAPM_fit.rsquared_adj)

<script.py> output:
    0.7942627160017834



#Extract the market beta of your portfolio.
# Extract the beta
regression_beta = CAPM_fit.params['Market_Excess']
print(regression_beta)
<script.py> output:
    0.9737755165745479
    
    

Your portfolio beta is once again 0.9738. The adjusted r-squared is 0.7943. A high adjusted r-squared (close to 1) means that the majority of your portfolio's movements can be explained by the factors in your model.
























Adjusted R-squared
Let's assume you conducted two different regression analyses using different financial models to explain returns. Based on the information below, which model is most likely superior?

Model	R-Squared	Adjusted R-Squared
Model 1	0.60	    0.35
Model 2	0.95	    0.40
Model 3	0.90	    0.75

#YES Model 3 is superior
# Model 3 has the highest adjusted r-squared!
