Calculating beta using co-variance
Beta is an essential component of many financial models, and is a measure of systematic risk, or exposure to the broad market. In the CAPM model, beta is one of two essential factors.

Historical beta can be estimated in a number of ways. In this exercise, you will use the following simple formula involving co-variance and variance to a benchmark market portfolio:

βP = Cov(RP,RB) / Var(RB)

βP:         Portfolio beta
Cov(RP,RB): The co-variance between the portfolio (P) and the benchmark market index (B)
Var(RB):    The variance of the benchmark market index

The FamaFrenchData DataFrame is available in your workspace and contains the proper data for this exercise.

Your portfolio beta is 0.9738. You can think of market beta as a measure of your exposure to the broad stock market. For every 1.0% rise (or fall) in the market, you can expect your portfolio to rise (fall) roughly 0.97%.
