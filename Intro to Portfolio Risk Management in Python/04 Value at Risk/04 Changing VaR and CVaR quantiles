Changing VaR and CVaR quantiles
VaR quantiles often used are 90%, 95%, and 99%, corresponding to the worst 10%, 5%, and 1% of cases respectively. These same quantiles are also often used for CVaR. Note that CVaR will always be a more extreme estimate when compared with VaR for the same quantile.

Compare the VaR vs CVaR values for USO ETF returns below.

Returns data is available (in percent) in StockReturns_perc. We also calculated var_95, cvar_95, var_99, cvar_99 and defined a function plot_hist() that compares several quantiles for you.





# Historical VaR(90) quantiles
var_90 = np.percentile(StockReturns_perc, 90)
print(var_90)

<script.py> output:
    -2.558512646965176


# Historical CVaR(90) quantiles
cvar_90 = StockReturns_perc[StockReturns_perc<=var_90].mean()
print(cvar_90)

<script.py> output:
    -4.043186770518807
