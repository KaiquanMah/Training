Your first TfIdf
In this exercise, you will apply the TfIdf method to the small annak dataset, containing the first sentence of Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy.
Your task will be to work with this dataset and apply the TfidfVectorizer() function. Recall that performing a numeric transformation of text is your first step in being able to understand the sentiment of the text. The Tfidf vectorizer is another way to construct a vocabulary from our sentiment column.

Import the function for building a Tfdif vectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text.
Call the TfidfVectorizer() function and fit it on the annak dataset .
Transform the vectorizer.

# Import the required function
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

annak = ['Happy families are all alike;', 'every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way']

# Call the vectorizer and fit it
anna_vect = TfidfVectorizer().fit(annak)

# Create the tfidf representation
anna_tfidf = anna_vect.transform(annak)

# Print the result 
print(anna_tfidf.toarray())

You have built your first numeric representation of text by applying a TfIdf vectorizer. Do you recall building a bag-of-words representation for the same data earlier? What differences do you notice?
