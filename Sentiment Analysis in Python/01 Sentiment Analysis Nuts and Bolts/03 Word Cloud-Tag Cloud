Your first word cloud
We saw in the video that word clouds are very intuitive and a great and fast way to get a first impression on what a piece of text is talking about.
In this exercise, you will build your first word cloud. A string east_of_eden has been defined for you. It contains one of the first sentences of John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden. You can inspect its contents in the IPython Shell.
The matplotlib.pyplot package has been imported for you as plt.

Import the required package to build a word cloud.
Generate a word cloud using the east_of_eden string. The background color has been specified as white.

from wordcloud import WordCloud
# Generate the word cloud from the east_of_eden string
cloud_east_of_eden = WordCloud(background_color="white").generate(east_of_eden)




Create a figure from the word cloud object you generated in the previous step.
Display the image.

# Generate the word cloud from the east_of_eden string
cloud_east_of_eden = WordCloud(background_color="white").generate(east_of_eden)

# Create a figure of the generated cloud
plt.imshow(cloud_east_of_eden, interpolation='bilinear')  
plt.axis('off')
# Display the figure
plt.show()

You have successfully generated your first word cloud from a small excerpt from Steinbeck's East of Eden. Wasn't that fun?












Which words are in the word cloud?
Let's continue with the word cloud exercises. A string called illuminated has been defined for you. It contains an emotionally charged quote from the book 'Everything is Illuminated' by Jonathan Safran Foer. Generate and display a word cloud using the illuminated string. Note that all required packages have been imported for you.

Which of the following answers contains only words you see in the word cloud?
wc = WordCloud(background_color="white").generate(illuminated)
plt.imshow(wc, interpolation='bilinear')  
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

Sad, other, happy.
Repeat, conversation , convince.
Know, thing, everything.

#yes Day, worse, others.
















Word Cloud on movie reviews
You have been working with the movie reviews dataset. You have explored the distribution of the reviews and have seen how long the longest and the shortest reviews are. But what do positive and negative reviews talk about?
In this exercise, you will practice building a word cloud of the top 100 positive reviews.
What are the words that pop up? Do they make sense to you?
The string descriptions has been created for you by concatenating the descriptions of the top 100 positive reviews. A movie-specific set of stopwords (very frequent words, such as the, a/an, and, which will not be very informative and we'd like to exclude from the graph) is available as my_stopwords. Recall that the interpolation argument makes the word cloud appear more smoothly.


Import the wordcloud function from the respective package.
Apply the word cloud function to the descriptions string. Set the background color as 'white', and change the stopwords argument.
Create a wordcloud image.
Finally, do not forget to display the image.

# Import the word cloud function  
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Create and generate a word cloud image 
my_cloud = WordCloud(background_color='white', stopwords=my_stopwords).generate(descriptions)

# Display the generated wordcloud image
plt.imshow(my_cloud, interpolation='bilinear') 
plt.axis("off")

# Don't forget to show the final image
plt.show()

Which words in this sample of positive reviews pop up the most?
