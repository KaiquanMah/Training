You can also use setDefaults() on individual getSymbols() source methods. This exercise will teach you how to change the default value for the from argument to getSymbols.yahoo().

You can find the arguments for a specific method by using help() (e.g. help("getSymbols.yahoo") or by calling args() to print them to the console (e.g. args(getSymbols.yahoo)). Calling getDefaults() will show you the current default values (if there are any).

Remember, you are not supposed to call getSymbols.yahoo() directly!



Use the args() function to print all the default arguments to getSymbols.yahoo().
Set the default of from for getSymbols.yahoo() to "2000-01-01".
Use getDefaults() to confirm that the from default was set correctly.


# Look at getSymbols.yahoo arguments
args(getSymbols.yahoo)
function (Symbols, env, return.class = "xts", index.class = "Date", 
    from = "2007-01-01", to = Sys.Date(), ..., periodicity = "daily", 
    curl.options = list()) 
NULL


# Set default 'from' value for getSymbols.yahoo
setDefaults(getSymbols.yahoo, from = "2000-01-01")

# Confirm defaults were set correctly
getDefaults("getSymbols.yahoo")
$from
[1] "'2000-01-01'"
