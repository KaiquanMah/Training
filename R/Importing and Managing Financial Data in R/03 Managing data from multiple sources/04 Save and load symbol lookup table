The previous exercise taught you how to set default arguments on a per-symbol basis, but those settings only last for the current session.

This exercise will teach you how to save and load symbol-based defaults by using saveSymbolLookup() and loadSymbolLookup(), respectively. You can use the file arguments to specify a file to store your defaults.

You can also use the getSymbolLookup() function to check per-symbol defaults before you try to load data using getSymbols().



The source for CP has already been set to "FRED".
Use saveSymbolLookup() to save the symbol lookup table to a file named "my_symbol_lookup.rda".
Set the source for CP to "yahoo" using what you learned in the prior exercise.
Use getSymbolLookup() to verify that the default source for CP actually changed from "FRED" to "yahoo".
Now use loadSymbolLookup() to load the saved symbol lookup table.

# Save symbol lookup table to file
saveSymbolLookup("my_symbol_lookup.rda")



# Set default source for CP to "yahoo"
setSymbolLookup(CP = list(src = "yahoo"))

# Verify the default source is "yahoo" for "CP"
getSymbolLookup("CP")
$CP
$CP$src
[1] "yahoo"




# Load symbol lookup table from file
loadSymbolLookup("my_symbol_lookup.rda")

getSymbolLookup("CP")
$CP
$CP$src
[1] "FRED"
