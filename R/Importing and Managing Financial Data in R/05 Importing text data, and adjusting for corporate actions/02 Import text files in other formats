The previous exercise taught you how to import well-formatted CSV data using getSymbols(). Unfortunately, most data are not well-formatted.

The zoo package provides several functions to import text files as zoo objects. The main function is read.zoo(), which wraps read.table(). The xts class extends zoo, so you can easily convert the result of read.zoo() into an xts object by using as.xts().

In this exercise, you will learn how you can use read.zoo() to import the same AMZN.csv data from the previous exercise.


Use read.zoo() to import AMZN.csv. Assign the output to an object named amzn_zoo.
Convert amzn_zoo to an xts object. Assign the output to an object named amzn_xts.
Look at the first few rows of amzn_xts.


# Import the AMZN.csv file using read.zoo
amzn_zoo <- read.zoo("AMZN.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
>amzn_zoo
           AMZN.Open AMZN.High AMZN.Low AMZN.Close AMZN.Volume AMZN.Adjusted
2002-01-02     11.13     11.01    10.46      10.87     6674703         10.87
 [ reached getOption("max.print") -- omitted 123 rows ]


# Convert to xts
amzn_xts <- as.xts(amzn_zoo)


# Look at the first few rows of amzn_xts
head(amzn_xts)

           AMZN.Open AMZN.High AMZN.Low AMZN.Close AMZN.Volume AMZN.Adjusted
2002-01-02     11.13     11.01    10.46      10.87     6674703         10.87
 [ reached getOption("max.print") -- omitted 5 rows ]
