The previous exercise taught you how to make a zero-width xts object with a regular time index. You can use the zero-width object to regularize an irregular xts object.

The regularized series usually has missing values (NA) because the irregular data does not have a value for all observations in the regular index. This exercise will teach you how to handle these missing values when you merge() the two series.

The irregular_xts and regular_xts objects from the previous exercise are available in your workspace.



Use the merge() function to combine irregular_xts and regular_xts into an object named merged_xts.
Use head() to look at the first few rows of merged_xts.
Create an object named merged_filled_xts by using the fill argument to merge() to replace the NA with the last observation, carried forward (na.locf).
Use head to look at the first few rows of merged_filled_xts.


# Merge irregular_xts and regular_xts
merged_xts <- merge(irregular_xts, regular_xts)


# Look at the first few rows of merged_xts
head(merged_xts)

# Use the fill argument to fill NA with their previous value
# merged_filled_xts <- na.locf(merged_xts)
merged_filled_xts <- merge(irregular_xts, regular_xts, fill = na.locf)


# Look at the first few rows of merged_filled_xts
head(merged_filled_xts)
