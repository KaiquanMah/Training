The previous exercise taught you how to use do.call(merge, eapply(env, fun)) to apply a function to each object in an environment and then combine all the results into one object.
Let's use what you learned to solve a very common problem. Often you will need to load similar data for many instruments, extract a column, and create one object that contains that specific column for every instrument.


Use new.env() to create a new environment named data_env.
Use getSymbols() to load data into data_env by using the env argument.
Finish the commands that have been started for you. Fill in the blanks with the appropriate functions.
View the first few rows of close_data.


# Symbols
symbols <- c("AAPL", "MSFT", "IBM")

# Create new environment
data_env <- new.env()
data_env
<environment: 0x55e9a3ef8650>

# Load symbols into data_env
getSymbols(Symbols = symbols, env=data_env)
[1] "AAPL" "MSFT" "IBM" 

#head(data_env)
#Error: object of type 'environment' is not subsettable


# Extract the close column from each object and combine into one xts object
close_data <- do.call(merge, eapply(data_env, Cl))

# View the head of close_data
head(close_data)
