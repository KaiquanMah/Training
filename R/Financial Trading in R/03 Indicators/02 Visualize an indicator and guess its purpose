Visualize an indicator and guess its purpose - I
Now you will visualize these indicators to understand why you might want to use the indicator and what it may represent. Recall that a trend indicator attempts to predict whether a price will continue in its current direction, whereas a reversion indicator attempts to predict whether an increasing price will soon decrease, or the opposite.
In this exercise, you will revisit the 200-day SMA. As a refresher, this indicator attempts to smooth out prices, but comes with a tradeoff - a lag. You will plot the prices of SPY and plot a 200-day SMA on top of the price series. Using this information, you will determine if it is a trend indicator or reversion indicator.
The quantmod and TTR packages and price series SPY have been loaded into your workspace.

Plot the closing prices of SPY.
Overlay a 200-day SMA of the closing prices using the lines() function and color it red.
Is the 200-day SMA a trend or a reversion indicator? Print your answer as either "trend" or "reversion" in the console.

# Plot the closing prices of SPY
plot(Cl(SPY))

# Overlay a 200-day SMA
lines(SMA(Cl(SPY), n = 200), col = "red")

# What kind of indicator?
"trend"
Great job! By averaging over a moving period of 200 days, the SMA helps indicate a trend rather than a reversion.

Visualize an indicator and guess its purpose - II
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another indicator that rises with positive price changes and falls with negative price changes. It is equal to 100 - 100/(1 + RS), where RS is the average gain over average loss over the lookback period. At various lengths, this indicator can range from a reversion indicator, to a trend filter, or anywhere in between. There are various ways of computing the RSI.
As you already know, RSI() takes in a price series price and a number of periods n which has a default value of 14. Some traders believe that the 2-period RSI, also known as the RSI 2, has even more important properties than the 14-period RSI.
In this exercise, rather than plotting this indicator on the actual price series, you'll look at a small, one year subset of SPY and how the RSI interacts with the price. The quantmod and TTR packages and SPY price series have been loaded into your workspace.


Plot the closing price of SPY.
Plot the RSI 2 of the closing price of SPY.
Is this a trend or a reversion indicator? Print your answer as either "trend" or "reversion" in the console.


# Plot the closing price of SPY
plot(Cl(SPY))
#looked very smooth

# Plot the RSI 2
plot(RSI(Cl(SPY), n = 2))
#looked very volatile with many ups and downs

# What kind of indicator?
"reversion"
Great job! By measuring the change of price movements, the RSI indicates a reversion rather than a trend.
