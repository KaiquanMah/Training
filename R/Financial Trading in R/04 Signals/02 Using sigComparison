Using sigComparison
A sigComparison signal is a simple and useful way to compare two (hopefully related) quantities, such as two moving averages. Often, a sigComparison signal does not create a buy or sell signal by itself (as such a signal would involve buying or selling on every such day), but is most often useful as a filter for when another buy or sell rule should be followed.
In this exercise, you will use sigComparison() to generate a signal comparison that specifies that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) must be above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). You will label this signal longfilter, because it signals that the short-term average is above the long-term average.

Use add.signal() to add a sigComparison specifying that SMA50 must be greater than SMA200.
Label this signal longfilter.


# Add a sigComparison which specifies that SMA50 must be greater than SMA200, call it longfilter
add.signal(strategy.st,
           name = "sigComparison", 
           
           # We are interested in the relationship between the SMA50 and the SMA200
           arguments = list(columns = c("SMA50", "SMA200"), 
                            
                            # Particularly, we are interested when the SMA50 is greater than the SMA200
                            relationship = "gt"),
           
           # Label this signal longfilter
           label = "longfilter")
           
           
Great job! You just added a sigComparison signal to your strategy.
