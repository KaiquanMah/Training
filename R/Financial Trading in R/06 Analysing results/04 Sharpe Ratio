Cash Sharpe ratio
When working with cash profit and loss statistics, quantstrat offers a way to compute a Sharpe ratio not just from returns, but from the actual profit and loss statistics themselves. A Sharpe ratio is a metric that compares the average reward to the average risk taken. Generally, a Sharpe ratio above 1 is a marker of a strong strategy.


In this exercise, you will see that because of trading P&L (profit and loss), one can compute a Sharpe ratio based on these metrics. The code below can be used to compute the Sharpe ratio based off of P&L. Copy the code in the console. In what range is the Sharpe ratio you obtain?
portpl <- .blotter$portfolio.firststrat$summary$Net.Trading.PL
SharpeRatio.annualized(portpl, geometric=FALSE)

                                Net.Trading.PL
Annualized Sharpe Ratio (Rf=0%)      0.5165484


#yes .45 - .55
Remember that a Sharpe ratio above 1 is indicative of a strong strategy. The Sharpe ratio identified here is a bit low.
















Returns Sharpe ratio in quantstrat
One of the main reasons to include an initial equity (in this case, initeq, which is set to 100,000) in your strategy is to be able to work with returns, which are based off of your profit and loss over your initial equity.
While you just computed a cash Sharpe ratio in the previous exercise, you will see in this exercise that quantstrat can also compute the standard returns-based Sharpe ratio as well.


Use PortfReturns() on our portfolio strategy portfolio.st to get the instrument returns.
Compute the annualized Sharpe ratio using the instrument returns computed in the previous step.
# Get instrument returns
instrets <- PortfReturns(portfolio.st)

# Compute Sharpe ratio from returns
SharpeRatio.annualized(instrets, geometric = FALSE)


                                SPY.DailyEqPL
Annualized Sharpe Ratio (Rf=0%)     0.5166274


You've now learned about the quantstrat package and you're ready to develop real-world trading strategies!
