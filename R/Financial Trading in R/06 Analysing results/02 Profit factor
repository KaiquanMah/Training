Profit factor
One of the most vital statistics of any systematic trading strategy is the profit factor. The profit factor is how many dollars you make for each dollar you lose. A profit factor above 1 means your strategy is profitable. A profit factor below 1 means you should head back to the drawing board.
In this exercise, you will explore the profit factor in your strategy by creating an object called tstats that displays the trade statistics for your system. In general, trade statistics are generated by using the tradeStats() command.

Use tradeStats() to create an object containing the trade statistics in your portfolio. Save this as tstats.
Use the object tstats object along with $ and Profit.Factor to report the profit factor for SPY. Is your strategy profitable?
# Get the tradeStats for your portfolio
tstats <- tradeStats(Portfolios = portfolio.st)

# Print the profit factor
tstats$Profit.Factor

Trade statistics such as the profit factor are a valuable component of assessing the effectiveness of your strategy.

















Percent positive
While profit factor is one important statistic, it may be heavily influenced by only a few good trades. The percent positive statistic lets you know how many of your trades were winners. A trading system based on oscillation trading (such as yours!) will likely have a high percentage of winners. This is certainly a statistic you should look for in your own trade statistics.
The trading statistics object you created in the last exercise (tstats) has been preloaded into your workspace. Examine it. What is the percent positive statistic?
> tstats$Percent.Positive
[1] 70.90909

This percent positive statistic means that approximately 71% of your trades returned a positive result. That's a great start!
