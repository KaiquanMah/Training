Latin Square with NYC SAT Scores
To execute a Latin Square design on this data, suppose we want to know the effect of our tutoring program, which includes one-on-one tutoring, two small groups, and an in and after-school SAT prep class. A new dataset nyc_scores_ls is available that represents this experiment. Feel free to explore the dataset in the console.
We'll block by Borough and Teacher_Education_Level to reduce their known variance on the score outcome. Borough is a good blocking factor because schools in America are funded partly based on taxes paid in each city, so it will likely make a difference in the quality of education.

Use lm() to test the changes in Average_Score_SAT_Math using nyc_scores_ls.
Tidy nyc_scores_ls_lm with the appropriate broom function.
Examine nyc_scores_ls_lm with anova().

At the 0.05 significance level, do we have evidence to believe the tutoring program has an effect on math SAT scores, when blocked by Borough and Teacher_Education_Level?
#not Yes! Given the p-value, we have reason to believe that the tutoring program had an effect on the Math score.

#right Nope! Given the p-value, we have no reason to reject the null hypothesis.
It seems that when we block for Borough of the school and Teacher_Education_Level, our Tutoring_Program isn't having a statistically significant effect on the Math SAT score.
