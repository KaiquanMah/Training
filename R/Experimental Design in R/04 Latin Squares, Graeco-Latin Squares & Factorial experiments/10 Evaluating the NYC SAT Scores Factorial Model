Evaluating the NYC SAT Scores Factorial Model
We've built our model, so we know what's next: model checking! We need to examine both if our outcome and our model residuals are normally distributed. We'll check the normality assumption using shapiro.test(). A low p-value means we can reject the null hypothesis that the sample came from a normally distributed population.
Let's carry out the requisite model checks for our 2^k factorial model, nyc_scores_factorial, which has been loaded for you.


Test the outcome Average_Score_SAT_Math from nyc_scores for normality using shapiro.test().
Set up a 2 by 2 grid for plots and plot the nyc_scores_factorial model object to create the residual plots.


# Use shapiro.test() to test the outcome
shapiro.test(nyc_scores$Average_Score_SAT_Math)

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  nyc_scores$Average_Score_SAT_Math
W = 0.84672, p-value < 2.2e-16




# Plot nyc_scores_factorial to examine residuals
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(nyc_scores_factorial)


The model appears to be fairly well fit, though our evidence indicates the score may not be from a normally distributed population. Looking at the Q-Q plot, we can see that towards the higher end, the points are not on the line, so we may not be dealing with normality here. If we had more time, we might consider a transformation on the outcome to move towards normality.
