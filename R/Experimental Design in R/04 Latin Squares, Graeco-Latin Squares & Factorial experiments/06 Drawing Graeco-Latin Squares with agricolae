Drawing Graeco-Latin Squares with agricolae
As we've seen, agricolae provides us the ability to draw all of the experimental designs we've used so far, and they can also draw Graeco-Latin squares. One difference in the input to design.graeco() that we haven't seen before is that we'll need to input 2 vectors, trt1 and trt2, which must be of equal length. You can think of trt1 as your actual treatment and trt2 as one of your blocking factors. agricolae has been loaded for you.


Create vectors trt1 with LETTERS A through E and trt2 with numbers 1 through 5.
Make my_graeco_design with design.graeco(), using and seed = 42.
Examine the parameters and sketch of my_graeco_design.

design.graeco
Graeco - Latin Square Design
A graeco - latin square is a KxK pattern that permits the study of k treatments simultaneously with three different blocking variables, each at k levels.
The function is only for squares of the odd numbers and even numbers (4, 8, 10 and 12)

Usage
design.graeco(trt1, trt2, serie = 2, seed = 0, kinds = "Super-Duper",randomization=TRUE)
Arguments
trt1
Treatments

trt2
Treatments

serie
number plot, 1: 11,12; 2: 101,102; 3: 1001,1002

seed
seed

kinds
method for to randomize

randomization
TRUE or FALSE - randomize






# Create trt1 and trt2
trt1 <- LETTERS[1:5]
# seq(start, stop-inclusive, step distance)
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7133413/how-to-generate-a-vector-containing-a-numeric-sequence-with-a-given-step
trt2 <- seq(1,5,1)


# Create my_graeco_design
my_graeco_design <- design.graeco(trt1, trt2, seed=42)



# Examine the parameters and sketch
my_graeco_design$parameters

$design
[1] "graeco"

$trt1
[1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E"

$trt2
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

$r
[1] 5

$serie
[1] 2

$seed
[1] 42

$kinds
[1] "Super-Duper"

[[8]]
[1] TRUE







my_graeco_design$sketch
     [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]  [,5] 
[1,] "D 2" "E 3" "A 1" "C 5" "B 4"
[2,] "E 1" "A 5" "C 4" "B 2" "D 3"
[3,] "A 4" "C 2" "B 3" "D 1" "E 5"
[4,] "C 3" "B 1" "D 5" "E 4" "A 2"
[5,] "B 5" "D 4" "E 2" "A 3" "C 1"

You can see that this time the sketch object includes your treatment (the capital letter) and a blocking factor (the number.)
