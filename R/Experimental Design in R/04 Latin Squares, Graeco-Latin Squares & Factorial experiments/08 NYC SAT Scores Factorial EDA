NYC SAT Scores Factorial EDA
Let's do some more EDA before we dive into the analysis of our factorial experiment.
Let's test the effect of Percent_Black_HL, Percent_Tested_HL, and Tutoring_Program on the outcome, Average_Score_SAT_Math. The HL stands for high-low, where a 1 indicates respectively that less than 50% of Black students or that less than 50% of all students in an entire school were tested, and a 2 indicates that greater than 50% of either were tested.
Build a boxplot of each factor vs. the outcome to have an idea of which have a difference in median by factor level (ultimately, mean difference is what's tested.) The nyc_scores dataset has been loaded for you.

Load ggplot2. Create a boxplot of the outcome versus Tutoring_Program.
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Build the boxplot for the tutoring program vs. Math SAT score
ggplot(nyc_scores,
       aes(x=Tutoring_Program, y=Average_Score_SAT_Math)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
    
Using ggplot2, create a boxplot of the outcome versus Percent_Black_HL.
# Build the boxplot for the percent black vs. Math SAT score
ggplot(nyc_scores,
       aes(x=Percent_Black_HL, y=Average_Score_SAT_Math)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
    
Using ggplot2, create a boxplot of the outcome versus Percent_Tested_HL.
# Build the boxplot for the percent black vs. Math SAT score
ggplot(nyc_scores,
       aes(x=Percent_Tested_HL, y=Average_Score_SAT_Math)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
    



Now, let's move on to the analysis of these factors on the score.
