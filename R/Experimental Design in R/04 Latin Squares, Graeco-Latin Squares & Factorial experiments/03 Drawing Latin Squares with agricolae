Drawing Latin Squares with agricolae
We return, once again, to the agricolae package to examine what a Latin Square design can look like. Here's an example:

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,] "B"  "D"  "A"  "C" 
[2,] "A"  "C"  "D"  "B" 
[3,] "D"  "B"  "C"  "A" 
[4,] "C"  "A"  "B"  "D"
Since a Latin Square experiment has two blocking factors, you can see that in this design, each treatment appears once in both each row (blocking factor 1) and each column (blocking factor 2).
Look at the help page for design.lsd() by typing ?design.lsd in the console for any help you need designing your Latin Square experiment.

Load the agricolae package.
Create and view the sketch of a Latin Square design, my_design_lsd, using treatments A, B, C, D, & E, and a seed of 42.

design.lsd
Latin Square Design
It generates Latin Square Design. "Random" uses the methods of number generation in R. The seed is by set.seed(seed, kinds).


Usage
design.lsd(trt, serie = 2, seed = 0, kinds = "Super-Duper",first=TRUE,randomization=TRUE)


Arguments
trt
Treatments

serie
number plot, 1: 11,12; 2: 101,102; 3: 1001,1002

seed
seed

kinds
method for to randomize

first
TRUE or FALSE - randomize rep 1

randomization
TRUE or FALSE - randomize


> LETTERS
 [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N" "O" "P" "Q" "R" "S"
[20] "T" "U" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z"

# Load agricolae
library(agricolae)

# Design a LS with 5 treatments A:E then look at the sketch
my_design_lsd <- design.lsd(trt=LETTERS[1:5], seed=42)

my_design_lsd$sketch
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] "B"  "E"  "D"  "A"  "C" 
[2,] "A"  "D"  "C"  "E"  "B" 
[3,] "E"  "C"  "B"  "D"  "A" 
[4,] "C"  "A"  "E"  "B"  "D" 
[5,] "D"  "B"  "A"  "C"  "E"



Perhaps you're thinking to yourself 'This looks a lot like a RCBD'â€¦bingo! It does, but as we know from the video, there are now two blocking factors in a LS design.
