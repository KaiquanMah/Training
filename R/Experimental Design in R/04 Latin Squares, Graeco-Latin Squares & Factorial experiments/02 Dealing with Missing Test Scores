Dealing with Missing Test Scores
If we want to use SAT scores as our outcome, we should examine missingness. Examine the pattern of missingness across all the variables in nyc_scores using miss_var_summary() from the naniar package. naniar integrates with Tidyverse code styling, including the pipe operator (%>%).
There are 60 missing scores in each subject. Though there are many R packages which help with more advanced forms of imputation, such as MICE, Amelia, and mi, we will continue to use simputation and impute_median().
Create a new dataset, nyc_scores_2 by imputing Math score by Borough, but note that impute_median() returns the imputed variable as type "impute". You'll convert the variable to the numeric in a separate step.
simputation and dplyr are loaded.

Load the naniar package.
Examine the missingness of variables in nyc_scores by piping it to miss_var_summary().
# Load naniar
library(naniar)

# Examine missingness with miss_var_summary()
nyc_scores %>%
  miss_var_summary()

Did the median scores change before and after imputation? (Hint: they shouldn't have changed by much, but rounding may have offset them by an integer or two.)
