A basic experiment
Let's dive into experimental design. Note that all of these concepts will be covered in more detail in the next video, "Hypothesis Testing."
ToothGrowth is a built-in R dataset from a study that examined the effect of three different doses of Vitamin C on the length of the odontoplasts, the cells responsible for teeth growth in 60 guinea pigs, where tooth length was the measured outcome variable.
Built-in data can be loaded with the data() function. The dataset will be loaded as a data frame with the same name passed as an argument to data(). For example, you can load the famous iris dataset using data("iris").

If you wanted to conduct a two-sided t-test with the famous mtcars dataset, it would look like this, where x is the outcome in question, alternative is set to "two.sided", and mu is the value you're testing to see if the mean of mpg is not equal to.
data(mtcars)
t.test(x = mtcars$mpg, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 40)

Suppose you know that the average length of a guinea pigs odontoplasts is 18 micrometers. Conduct a two-sided t-test on the ToothGrowth dataset. Here, a two-sided t-test will check to see if the mean of len is not equal to 18.

> ToothGrowth
    len supp dose
1   4.2   VC  0.5
2  11.5   VC  0.5
...
60 23.0   OJ  2.0



# Load the ToothGrowth dataset
data("ToothGrowth")

# Perform a two-sided t-test
t.test(x = ToothGrowth$len, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 18)

	One Sample t-test

data:  ToothGrowth$len
t = 0.82361, df = 59, p-value = 0.4135
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 18
95 percent confidence interval:
 16.83731 20.78936
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 18.81333
 
Given the high p-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean of len is equal to 18. That is, we don't have evidence that it is different from 18 micrometers. P-values and hypothesis testing will be covered in more detail in the next video.
