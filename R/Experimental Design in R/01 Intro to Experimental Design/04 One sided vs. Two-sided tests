One sided vs. Two-sided tests
Recall in the first exercise that we tested to see if the mean of the guinea pigs' teeth in ToothGrowth was not equal to 18 micrometers. That was an example of a two-sided t-test: we wanted to see if the mean of len is some other number on either side of 18.
We can also conduct a one-sided t-test, explicitly checking to see if the mean is less than or greater than 18. 

Whether to use a one- or two-sided test usually follows from your research question. 
Does an intervention cause longer tooth growth? One-sided, greater than. 
Does a drug cause the test group to lose more weight? 
One-sided, less than. Is there a difference in mean test scores between two groups of students? Two-sided test.

The ToothGrowth data has been loaded for you.
Test to see if the mean of the length variable of ToothGrowth is less than 18.

# Less than
t.test(x = ToothGrowth$len,
       alternative = "less",
       mu = 18)

One Sample t-test

data:  ToothGrowth$len
t = 0.82361, df = 59, p-value = 0.7933
alternative hypothesis: true mean is less than 18
95 percent confidence interval:
     -Inf 20.46358
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 18.81333




Test to see if the mean of the length variable of ToothGrowth is greater than 18.
# Greater than
t.test(x = ToothGrowth$len,
       alternative = "greater",
       mu = 18)

	One Sample t-test

data:  ToothGrowth$len
t = 0.82361, df = 59, p-value = 0.2067
alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 18
95 percent confidence interval:
 17.16309      Inf
sample estimates:

It turns out the mean of len is actually very close to 18, so neither of these tests tells us much about the
