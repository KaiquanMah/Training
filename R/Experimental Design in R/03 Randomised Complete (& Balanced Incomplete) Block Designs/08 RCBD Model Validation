RCBD Model Validation
As we did in the last chapter (and when building any model!) it's a good idea to validate the results. We'll examine the Residuals vs. Fitted and Normal Q-Q plots, though now we'll only see a Constant Leverage plot in place of the other two. A good model has a Q-Q plot showing an approximately normal distribution and no clear patterns across blocks or treatments in the others.
We can also look at Interaction plots. We hope to see parallel lines, no matter which of the block or the treatment is on the x-axis. If they are, they satisfy a key assumption of the RCBD model called Additivity.
The nhanes_rcbd model object from the last exercise has been loaded for you. Examine the results with summary(nhanes_rcbd) in the console if you need a refresher.


Plot the nhanes_rcbd model object, being sure to set up a 2x2 grid of plots beforehand.

# Set up the 2x2 plotting grid and plot nhanes_rcbd
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(nhanes_rcbd)
#Normal Q-Q plot showed a gentle quadratic curve increasing as we move from left to right
#the result does not seem to satisfy the normality assumption


Run the code to view the interaction plot between the treatment and gender and observe if the lines are parallel.
# Run the code to view the interaction plots
with(nhanes_final, interaction.plot(mcq365d, riagendr, bmxwt))
#with the mean wt 'bmxwt' on the y-axis and treatment groups 'mcq365d' on the x-axis
#separate lines based on the blocking gender variable 'riagendr'
#bottom line is alittle steeper than the top line


Run the code to view the interaction plot between gender and the treatment (it'll be a little different!) and observe if the lines are parallel.
# Run the code to view the interaction plots
with(nhanes_final, interaction.plot(riagendr, mcq365d, bmxwt))
#with the mean wt 'bmxwt' on the y-axis and blocking gender variable 'riagendr' on the x-axis
#separate lines based on the treatment groups 'mcq365d'
#bottom line is alittle steeper than the top line



Excellent! The initial diganostic plots show that this model is pretty good but not great - especially at the larger end of the data, the Q-Q plot shows the data might not be normal. 
The interaction plots show nearly parallel lines, so we can move forward with this model.

# seems like interactions plots deviating slightly from perfectly parallel lines still manage to satisfy the 'additivity' assumption of RCBD models
