NHANES dataset construction
As downloaded from the NHANES website, the NHANES datasets are available only as separate .XPT files, a native format to SAS. Luckily for us, the haven package exists.
Let's combine the NHANES Demographics, Medical Conditions, and Body Measures datasets, available in their raw .XPT format and accessible through the variables DEMO_file, MCQ_file, and BMX_file. Join all 3 datasets using the SEQN variable. A good way to do this is using Reduce(), which allows you to combine elements in a helpful way.

The joining code, which is provided for you does the following:
Creates a list of all 3 datasets (nhanes_demo, nhanes_medical, nhanes_bodymeasures).
Uses a custom function inside of Reduce() to inner join all 3 datasets with the "SEQN" variable.
Saves this as the nhanes_combined dataset.

> DEMO_file
[1] "/usr/local/share/datasets/DEMO_I.XPT"
> BMX_file
[1] "/usr/local/share/datasets/BMX_I.XPT"
> MCQ_file
[1] "/usr/local/share/datasets/MCQ_I.XPT"



# Load haven
library(haven)

# Import the three datasets using read_xpt()
nhanes_demo <- read_xpt(DEMO_file)
nhanes_bodymeasures <- read_xpt(BMX_file)
nhanes_medical <- read_xpt(MCQ_file)

# Merge the 3 datasets you just created to create nhanes_combined
nhanes_combined <- list(nhanes_demo, nhanes_medical, nhanes_bodymeasures) %>%
  Reduce(function(df1, df2) inner_join(df1, df2, by = "SEQN"), .)
