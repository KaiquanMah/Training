NHANES BIBD
Let's jump back into the NHANES data and pretend we have access to NHANES patients ages 18-45. Blocking the adults by race, stored in NHANES as ridreth1, we prescribe to our groups either no particular upper body weightlifting regimen, a weightlifting regimen, or a weightlifting regimen plus a prescribed daily vitamin supplement. This information is stored in a variable called weightlift_treat.
Those funding the study decide they want it to be a BIBD where only 2 treatments appear in each block. The outcome, arm circumference, is stored as bmxarmc. The nhanes_final data is loaded for you.

Calculate lambda where t = 3, k = 2, and r = 2. Does a BIBD exist here?
Create weightlift_model and examine the results. The experiment evaluates the outcome bmxarmc, where the treatment is stored in weightlift_treat and subjects are blocked by ridreth1.

# Calculate lambda
lambda(t=3, k=2, r=2)

# Create weightlift_model & examine results
# bmxarmc - y - arm circumference
# weightlift_treat - x - prescribe to our groups either no particular upper body weightlifting regimen, a weightlifting regimen, or a weightlifting regimen plus a prescribed daily vitamin supplement
# block on race
weightlift_model <- aov(bmxarmc ~ weightlift_treat + ridreth1, data=nhanes_final)

Call:
   aov(formula = bmxarmc ~ weightlift_treat + ridreth1, data = nhanes_final)

As it turns out, the weight lifting regimen doesn't seem to have a significant effect on arm circumference when the patient population is blocked by race.
