Possible Answers

TRUE      The benchmark should reflect the universe of assets and/or style of the portfolio


NOT TRUE     The benchmark should have poor performance so the portfolio always has good relative performance
Correct! Benchmarks should never be purposefully designed to have poor performance, as this would skew your results!
