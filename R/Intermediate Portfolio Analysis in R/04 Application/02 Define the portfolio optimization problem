We define the portfolio optimization problem to minimize portfolio standard deviation subject to full investment and long only constraints. In this problem, we will set up the portfolio specification based on the defined problem. The following exercises in this chapter will build on the initial portfolio specification set up here.


Create a portfolio specification object using assets from the asset_returns dataset and name the portfolio specification object port_spec.
Add a full investment constraint such that the weights sum to 1 to the port_spec object.
Add a long only constraint such that the weight of an asset is between 0 and 1 to the port_spec object.
Add an objective to minimize portfolio standard deviation to the port_spec object.
Print the portfolio specification object.


# Create the portfolio specification
port_spec <- portfolio.spec(assets = colnames(asset_returns))


# Add a full investment constraint such that the weights sum to 1
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec,
                            type = "full_investment")
                            
                            
# Add a long only constraint such that the weight of an asset is between 0 and 1
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec,
                            type = "long_only")
                            
                            
# Add an objective to minimize portfolio standard deviation
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec,
                           type = "risk",
                           name = "StdDev")


# Print the portfolio specification
print(port_spec)
