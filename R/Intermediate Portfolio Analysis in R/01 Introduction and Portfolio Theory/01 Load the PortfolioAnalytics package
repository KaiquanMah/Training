The package PortfolioAnalytics will be used throughout this course for portfolio optimization and analysis. We will use the indexes dataset that is included with the PortfolioAnalytics package for the remaining exercises in this chapter. In this exercise, we will load the package and prepare the data for the portfolio optimization problem in the next exercise.

Load the indexes dataset.
Subset the indexes dataset to use the first four columns and assign to a variable named index_returns.
