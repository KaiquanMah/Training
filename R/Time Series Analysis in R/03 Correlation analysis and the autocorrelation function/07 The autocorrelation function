Autocorrelations can be estimated at many lags to better assess how a time series relates to its past. We are typically most interested in how a series relates to its most recent past.

The acf(..., lag.max = ..., plot = FALSE) function will estimate all autocorrelations from 0, 1, 2,â€¦, up to the value specified by the argument lag.max. In the previous exercise, you focused on the lag-1 autocorrelation by setting the lag.max argument to 1.

In this exercise, you'll explore some further applications of the acf() command. Once again, the time series x has been preloaded for you and is shown in the plot on the right.


Use acf() to view the autocorrelations of series x from 0 to 10. Set the lag.max argument to 10 and keep the plot argument as FALSE.
Run the acf() code, and copy and paste the autocorrelation estimate (ACF) at lag-10 from the output.
Repeat this for the autocorrelation estimate (ACF) at lag-5.



# Generate ACF estimates for x up to lag-10
acf(x, lag.max = 10, plot = FALSE)

Autocorrelations of series 'x', by lag

    0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10 
1.000 0.758 0.537 0.345 0.227 0.198 0.140 0.114 0.124 0.118 0.100 


# Type the ACF estimate at lag-10 
0.100
[1] 0.1


# Type the ACF estimate at lag-5
0.198
[1] 0.198




Since autocorrelations may vary by lag, we often consider autocorrelations as a function of the time lag. Taking this view, we have now estimated the autocorrelation function (ACF) of x from lags 0 to 10.
