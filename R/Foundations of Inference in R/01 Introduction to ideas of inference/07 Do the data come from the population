Do the data come from the population?
Recall that the observed difference (i.e. the difference in proportions in the homes dataset, shown as the red vertical line) was around -0.0078, which seems to fall below the bulk of the density of shuffled differences. It is important to know, however, whether any of the randomly permuted differences were as extreme as the observed difference.

In this exercise, you'll re-create this dotplot as a density plot and count the number of permuted differences that were to the left of the observed difference.





The homeown_perm dataset is available in your workspace.

Using geom_density(), plot the permuted differences.
Add a vertical red line with geom_vline() where the observed difference falls. diff_orig is provided in your workspace and represents the original value of the difference statistic.
Count the number of permuted differences that were less than or equal to the observed difference.

212 permuted differences are more extreme than the observed difference. This only represents 21.2% of the null statistics, so you can conclude that the observed difference is consistent with the permuted distribution.

What can you conclude from the analysis?

We have learned that our data is consistent with the hypothesis of no difference in home ownership across gender.
#Right! We've failed to reject the null hypothesis.
