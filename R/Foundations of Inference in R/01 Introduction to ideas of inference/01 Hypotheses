Hypotheses (1)
Suppose a pharmaceutical company is trying to get FDA approval for a new diabetes treatment called drug A. Currently, most doctors prescribe drug B to treat diabetes.

Which would be a good null hypothesis for the FDA statistician examining the drug company's data?

#NOT Drug A is better than drug B at treating diabetes.
#NOT Drug A is worse than drug B at treating diabetes.
#NOT Drug A is different than drug B at treating diabetes (but you don't know if it is better or worse).
#YES Drug A is the same as drug B at treating diabetes.





Hypotheses (2)
Consider the same situation as in the last exercise. A pharmaceutical company is trying to pass drug A for diabetes through the FDA, but most doctors currently prescribe drug B.

Which would be a good alternative hypothesis?

#YES Drug A is better than drug B at treating diabetes.
#Correct! The alternative hypothesis corresponds to the research question of interest, in this case whether drug A is more - at treating diabetes than drug B.


#NOT Drug A is worse than drug B at treating diabetes.
#NOT Drug A is different than drug B at treating diabetes (but you don't know if it is better or worse).
#NOT Drug A is the same as drug B at treating diabetes.
