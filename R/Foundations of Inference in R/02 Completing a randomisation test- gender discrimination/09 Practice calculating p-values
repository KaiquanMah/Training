Practice calculating p-values
In the original dataset, 87.5% of the men were promoted and 58.3% of the women were promoted.

Consider a situation where there are 24 men, 24 women, and 35 people are still promoted. But in this new scenario, 75% of the men are promoted and 70.8% of the women are promoted. Does the difference in promotion rates still appear to be statistically significant? That is, could this difference in promotion rates have come from random chance?

You'll analyze these new data, contained in disc_new, using the same permutation algorithm from before.

The disc_perm and disc_perm_new datasets are available in your workspace.







Part 1
Run the code to recall the counts of sex and promote in the original dataset.
Get the counts in the new dataset, disc_new.

2      promoted   male

# Recall the original data
disc %>% 
  count(sex, promote)

# A tibble: 4 x 3
  sex    promote          n
  <fct>  <fct>        <int>
1 female not_promoted    10
2 female promoted        14
3 male   not_promoted     3
4 male   promoted        21


# Tabulate the new data
disc_new %>%
  count(sex, promote)

# A tibble: 4 x 3
  sex    promote          n
  <fct>  <fct>        <int>
1 female not_promoted     7
2 female promoted        17
3 male   not_promoted     6
4 male   promoted        18









Part 2
Run the code to recall the histogram of the difference statistic in the original permutation dataset.
Draw the histogram with the new permutation dataset, disc_perm_new. On this plot, set the x-axis intercept of the vertical line to diff_orig_new.


> diff_orig
[1] 0.2916667
> diff_orig_new
[1] 0.04166667



# Recall the distribution of the original permuted differences
ggplot(disc_perm, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_orig), color = "red")

# Plot the distribution of the new permuted differences
ggplot(disc_perm_new, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_orig_new), color = "red")











Part 3
Run the code to recall the p-value of the difference statistic in the original permutation dataset.
Calculate the p-value with the new permutation dataset, disc_perm_new, and the new observed difference, diff_orig_new.



# Recall the p-value from the original data
disc_perm %>%
  summarize(p_value = mean(diff_orig <= stat))
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  p_value
    <dbl>
1    0.03



# Find the p-value from the new data
disc_perm_new %>%
  summarize(p_value = mean(diff_orig_new <= stat))
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  p_value
    <dbl>
1   0.478
