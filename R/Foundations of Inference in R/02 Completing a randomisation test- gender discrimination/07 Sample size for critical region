Sample size for critical region
Using the randomization distributions with the small and big datasets, calculate different cutoffs for significance. Remember, you are most interested in a large positive difference in promotion rates, so you are calculating the upper quantiles of 0.90, 0.95, and 0.99.

A function for calculating these quantiles, calc_upper_quantiles() is sown in the script.






As a reference point, run the call to calc_upper_quantiles() to calculate the relevant quantiles associated with the original dataset of 1000 permuted differences, disc_perm.
Do the same for the small dataset, disc_perm_small ...
and for the big dataset, disc_perm_big.


calc_upper_quantiles <- function(dataset) {
  dataset %>% 
    summarize(
      q.90 = quantile(stat, p = 0.90),
      q.95 = quantile(stat, p = 0.95),
      q.99 = quantile(stat, p = 0.99)
    )
}

# Recall the quantiles associated with the original dataset
calc_upper_quantiles(disc_perm)
# A tibble: 1 x 3
   q.90  q.95  q.99
  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
1 0.125 0.208 0.292



# Calculate the quantiles associated with the small dataset
#dataset is 1/3 smaller than the original dataset count
calc_upper_quantiles(disc_perm_small)
# A tibble: 1 x 3
   q.90  q.95  q.99
  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
1  0.25  0.25   0.5



# Calculate the quantiles associated with the big dataset
#dataset is 10X bigger than the original dataset count
calc_upper_quantiles(disc_perm_big)
# A tibble: 1 x 3
    q.90   q.95  q.99
   <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>
1 0.0500 0.0667 0.100

Notice how the differences in proportions must be much larger to be significant if the sample size is small. With a big sample size, a small difference in proportions can be significant.
