What is the parameter?
In November 2016, the voters elected a new president of the United States. Prior to the election, thousands of polls were taken to gauge the popularity of each of the candidates. Leaving aside the idea that popular opinion changes over time, a poll can be thought of as a sample of individuals measured so as to estimate the proportion of all voters who will vote for each candiate (i.e. the population parameter).

Consider an election in your home town that will take place in a week's time. You poll a randomly selected subset of the voters in your town and ask them if they plan to vote for Candidate X or Candidate Y. In this chapter, we will focus on sampling variabilityâ€”the variability in sample proportions due to polling different randomly selected individuals from the population.

Before investigating the sampling variability, what is the population parameter of interest?


#not The proportion of individuals in a given poll who will vote for Candidate X.
The population parameter has to do with all voters.

#not The variability of the sample proportion from poll to poll.

#yes The proportion of all voters in your town who will vote for Candidate X on election day.
















Hypothesis test or confidence interval?
A university is trying to determine whether parking is a problem on its campus. The student newspaper contacts a random sample of 200 students and asks whether or not they are frustrated with the parking situation. They want to estimate the proportion of students at the college who are frustrated with the parking situation.

In this setting, which is more appropriate, a hypothesis test or a confidence interval?

#not Hypothesis test because there is a particular research claim.

#yes Confidence interval because the goal is to estimate a population parameter.
