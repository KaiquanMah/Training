Bootstrap t-confidence interval
The previous exercises told you two things:

You can measure the variability associated with p^ by resampling from the original sample.
Once you know the variability of p^, you can use it as a way to measure how far away the true proportion is.
Note that the rate of closeness (here 95%) refers to how often a sample is chosen so that it is close to the population parameter. You won't ever know if a particular dataset is close to the parameter or far from it, but you do know that over your lifetime, 95% of the samples you collect should give you estimates that are within 2SE of the true population parameter.

The votes from a single poll, one_poll, and the data from 1000 bootstrap resamples, one_poll_boot are available in your workspace. These are based on Experiment 2 from earlier in the chapter.

As in the previous exercise, when discussing the variability of a statistic, the number is referred to as the standard error.









Calculate p^ and assign the result to p_hat. In the call to summarize(), calculate stat as the mean of vote equalling "yes".

Find an interval of values that are plausible for the true parameter by calculating p^Â±2SE.
The lower bound of the confidence interval is p_hat minus twice the standard error of stat. Use sd() to calculate the standard error.
The upper bound is p_hat plus twice the standard error of stat.

one_poll <- all_polls %>%
  filter(poll == 1) %>%
  select(vote)
one_poll_boot <- one_poll %>%
  specify(response = vote, success = "yes") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
  
p_hat <- one_poll %>%
  # Calculate proportion of yes votes
  summarize(stat = mean(vote == "yes")) %>%
  pull()

# Create an interval of plausible values
one_poll_boot %>%
  summarize(
    # Lower bound is p_hat minus 2 std errs
    lower = p_hat - 2*sd(stat),
    # Upper bound is p_hat plus 2 std errs
    upper = p_hat + 2*sd(stat)
  )

Remember that a confidence level describes how likely you are to have gotten a sample that was close enough to the true parameter. Indeed, with the sample at hand, the confidence interval of plausible values does contain the true population parameter of 0.6. Nice
