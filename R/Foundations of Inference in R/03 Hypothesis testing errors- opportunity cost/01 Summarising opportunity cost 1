Summarising opportunity cost 1
As you saw in the video, we're interested in whether the treatment and control groups were equally likely to buy a DVD after reading the experimental statements.

In this exercise, you'll use the data from the study to find the sample statistics (here: proportions) that are needed for the analysis.
