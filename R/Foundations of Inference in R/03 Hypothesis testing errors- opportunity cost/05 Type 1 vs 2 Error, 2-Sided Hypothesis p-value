Different choice of error rate
Consider again a situation where the task is to differentiate the proportion of successes across two different groups. What decision should be made if the goal is to never make a type II error (false negative)?

#not Never claim there is a difference in proportions.


#yes Always claim there is a difference in proportions.
Right! If you always claim there is a difference in proportions, you'll always reject the null hypothesis, so you'll only make type I errors, if any.


#not Claim there is a difference in proportions only if the difference is large enough.
While this is a good strategy, it will lead to sometimes making a type II error.


















Errors for two-sided hypotheses
Sometimes you'll be interested in identifying any difference in proportions (as opposed to one larger proportion). Consider these slightly adjusted hypotheses for the opportunity cost example:
H0: Reminding students that they can save money for later purchases will not have any impact on students' spending decisions.
HA: Reminding students that they can save money for later purchases will change the chance they will continue with a purchase.

What are type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors for the two-sided hypotheses related to the opportunity costs example?

#yes
Type I: False POS. There is not a difference in proportions, but the observed difference is big enough to indicate that the proportions are different.
Type II: False NEG. There is a difference in proportions, but the observed difference is not large enough to indicate that the proportions are different.



























p-value for two-sided hypotheses: opportunity costs
The p-value measures the likelihood of data as or more extreme than the observed data, given the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, the appropriate p-value for a two-sided alternative hypothesis is a two-sided p-value.

To find a two-sided p-value, you simply double the one sided p-value. That is, you want to find two times the proportion of permuted differences that are less than or equal to the observed difference.

The opp_perm data frame, containing the differences in permuted proportions, and the original observed statistic, diff_orig, are available in your workspace.



Use opp_perm to compute the two-sided p-value, or twice the proportion of permuted differences that are less than or equal to the original difference.

> diff_orig
[1] -0.2

# Calculate the two-sided p-value
opp_perm %>%
  summarize(p_value = 2*mean(stat <= diff_orig))

# A tibble: 1 x 1
  p_value
    <dbl>
1   0.014

Take a moment to remind yourself why you used the proportion of permuted statistics that are smaller than (instead of bigger than) the observed value. Hint: look at the histogram of permuted statistics.
