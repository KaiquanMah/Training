Plotting opportunity cost
Again, interest is in whether the treatment and control groups were equally likely to buy a DVD after reading the experimental statements. Here, you'll create a barplot to visualize the difference in proportions between the treatment and control groups.





Using the opportunity dataset, plot group filled by decision.
Call geom_bar() to add a bar plot layer, setting the position argument to "fill" to compare relative frequencies. Note that fill should be defined by the decision for each group.



# Plot group, filled by decision
ggplot(opportunity, aes(x = group, fill = decision)) + 
  # Add a bar layer, with position "fill"
  #create stacked bar chart with proportion of buy vs nobuy for the control vs the treatment groups
  geom_bar(position="fill")
  
  

The barplot better displays the results from the study. The treatment seems like it might have had an effect.
