Randomising opportunity cost
As in Chapter 2 Exercise 5, you will permute the data to generate a distribution of differences as if the null hypothesis were true.

In the study, the number of individuals in each of the control and treatment groups is fixed. Additionally, when you assume that the null hypothesis is true—that is, the experiment had no effect on the outcome of buying a DVD—it is reasonable to infer that the number of individuals who would buy a DVD is also fixed. That is, 97 people were going to buy a DVD regardless of which treatment group they were in.

Using the new data and the methods from the previous chapter, create a randomization distribution of the difference in proportions calculated on permuted data.





Part 1
Using the opportunity dataset, calculate the observed difference in purchase rate.
Group by group.
Summarize to calculate the proportion deciding to buy a DVD. That is, get the mean() of cases of decision equalling "buyDVD".
Summarize again to calculate the diff()erence of prop_buy between groups.

> diff_obs <- opportunity %>%
    group_by(group)
> diff_obs
# A tibble: 150 x 2
# Groups:   group [2]
   decision group  
   <fct>    <fct>  
 1 buyDVD   control
 2 buyDVD   control
 3 buyDVD   control
 4 buyDVD   control
 5 buyDVD   control
 6 buyDVD   control
 7 buyDVD   control
 8 buyDVD   control
 9 buyDVD   control
10 buyDVD   control
# ... with 140 more rows





> diff_obs <- opportunity %>%
    group_by(group) %>%
    summarise(prop_buy = mean(decision == "buyDVD"))
> diff_obs
# A tibble: 2 x 2
  group     prop_buy
  <fct>        <dbl>
1 control      0.747
2 treatment    0.547    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

# Calculate the observed difference in purchase rate
diff_obs <- opportunity %>%
  # Group by group
  group_by(group) %>%
  # Calculate proportion deciding to buy a DVD
  summarise(prop_buy = mean(decision == "buyDVD")) %>%
  # Calculate difference between groups
  summarise(stat = diff(prop_buy)) %>% 
  pull()   

> diff_obs
[1] -0.2














Part 2
Create a data frame of permuted differences in purchase rates.
Specify the model decision vs. group, with the success value "buyDVD".
Hypothesise "independence".
Generate 1000 reps of type "permute".
Calculate the summary statistic "diff in props".


# Create data frame of permuted differences in purchase rates
opp_perm <- opportunity %>%
  # Specify decision vs. group, where success is buying a DVD
  specify(decision ~ group, success = "buyDVD") %>%
  # Set the null hypothesis to independence
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  # Generate 1000 reps of type permute
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  # Calculate the summary stat difference in proportions
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("treatment", "control"))
    
# Review the result
opp_perm

# A tibble: 1,000 x 2
   replicate    stat
       <int>   <dbl>
 1         1 -0.0133
 2         2  0.0933
 3         3 -0.0133
 4         4 -0.0133
 5         5  0.0933
 6         6  0.307 
 7         7 -0.0933
 8         8 -0.0400
 9         9  0.0133
10        10  0.0133
# ... with 990 more rows


















Part 3
Draw a histogram of permuted differences.
Using the permutation dataset, opp_perm, plot stat.
Add a histogram layer with geom_histogram(). The binwidth is set to 0.005.
Add a vertical line with geom_vline(). The xintercept is at diff_obs.




> diff_obs
[1] -0.2

# From previous steps
diff_obs <- opportunity %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarize(prop_buy = mean(decision == "buyDVD")) %>%
  summarize(stat = diff(prop_buy)) %>% 
  pull()
opp_perm <- opportunity %>%
  specify(decision ~ group, success = "buyDVD") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("treatment", "control"))
  
# Using the permuation data, plot stat
ggplot(opp_perm, aes(x = stat)) + 
  # Add a histogram layer with binwidth 0.005
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.005) +
  # Add a vline layer with intercept diff_obs
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_obs), color = "red")



In the next exercise, you'll calculate the p-value to judge if the difference in proportions permuted is consistent with the observed difference.
