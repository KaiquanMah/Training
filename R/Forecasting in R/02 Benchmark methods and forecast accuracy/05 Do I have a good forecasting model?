Which one of the following statements is true?

Possible Answers

Good forecast methods should have normally distributed residuals.
No, normality of residuals makes life easier but is not essential.


NO      A model with small residuals will give good forecasts.
No, small residuals only means that the model fits the training data well, not that it produces good forecasts.
resid is the difference between actual training Y vs fitted Y values
forecast error = difference between actual test Y vs forecasted/predicted Y values


DEPENDS?   If your model doesnâ€™t forecast well, you should make it more complicated.
No, making a model more complicated does not necessarily lead to better forecasts.


YES       Where possible, try to find a model that has low RMSE on a test set and has white noise residuals.
A good model forecasts well (so has low RMSE on the test set) and uses all available information in the training data (so has white noise residuals).
