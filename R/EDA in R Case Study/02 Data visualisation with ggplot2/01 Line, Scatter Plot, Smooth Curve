Choosing an aesthetic
You're going to create a line graph to show the trend over time of how many votes are "yes".

Which of the following aesthetics should you map the year variable to?

X-axis
To plot a line graph to show the trend over time, the year variable should be on the x-axis.










Plotting a line over time
In the last chapter, you learned how to summarize() the votes dataset by year, particularly the percentage of votes in each year that were "yes".
You'll now use the ggplot2 package to turn your results into a visualization of the percentage of "yes" votes over time.


The by_year dataset has the number of votes and percentage of "yes" votes each year.
Load the ggplot2 package.
Use ggplot() with the geom_line layer to create a line plot with year on the x-axis and percent_yes on the y-axis.



# Define by_year
by_year <- votes_processed %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Create line plot
ggplot(by_year, aes(x=year, y=percent_yes)) +
  geom_line()









Other ggplot2 layers
A line plot is one way to display this data. You could also choose to display it as a scatter plot, with each year represented as a single point. This requires changing the layer (i.e. geom_line() to geom_point()).

You can also add additional layers to your graph, such as a smoothing curve with geom_smooth().
