Faceting the time series
Now you'll take a look at six countries. While in the previous exercise you used color to represent distinct countries, this gets a little too crowded with six.

Instead, you will facet, giving each country its own sub-plot. To do so, you add a facet_wrap() step after all of your layers.




Create a filtered version that contains these six countries called filtered_6_countries.
Use the filtered dataset (containing summarized data for six countries) to create a plot with one facet for each country.

# Vector of six countries to examine
countries <- c("United States", "United Kingdom",
               "France", "Japan", "Brazil", "India")

# Filtered by_year_country: filtered_6_countries
filtered_6_countries <- by_year_country %>%
  filter(country %in% countries)

# Line plot of % yes over time faceted by country
ggplot(filtered_6_countries, aes(x=year, y=percent_yes)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~country)












Faceting with free y-axis
In the previous plot, all six graphs had the same axis limits. This made the changes over time hard to examine for plots with relatively little change.

Instead, you may want to let the plot choose a different y-axis for each facet.
Change the faceted plot so that the y-axis is freely chosen for each facet, rather than being the same for all six.


# Vector of six countries to examine
countries <- c("United States", "United Kingdom",
               "France", "Japan", "Brazil", "India")

# Filtered by_year_country: filtered_6_countries
filtered_6_countries <- by_year_country %>%
  filter(country %in% countries)

# Line plot of % yes over time faceted by country
ggplot(filtered_6_countries, aes(year, percent_yes)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ country, scales = free_y)
  















Choose your own countries
The purpose of an exploratory data analysis is to ask questions and answer them with data. Now it's your turn to ask the questions.

You'll choose some countries whose history you are interested in and add them to the graph. If you want to look up the full list of countries, enter by_country$country in the console.
Add three more countries to the countries vector and therefore to the faceted graph.
