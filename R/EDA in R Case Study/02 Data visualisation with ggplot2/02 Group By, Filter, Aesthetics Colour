Summarizing by year and country
You're more interested in trends of voting within specific countries than you are in the overall trend. So instead of summarizing just by year, summarize by both year and country, constructing a dataset that shows what fraction of the time each country votes "yes" in each year.


votes_processed %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))
# A tibble: 34 x 3
    year total percent_yes

 3  1951  1434       0.585
 4  1953  1537       0.632
 5  1955  2169       0.695
 6  1957  2708       0.609
 7  1959  4326       0.588

Plotting just the UK over time
Now that you have the percentage of time that each country voted "yes" within each year, you can plot the trend for a particular country. In this case, you'll look at the trend for just the United Kingdom.

This will involve using filter() on your data before giving it to ggplot2.


Print the by_year_country dataset.
Create a filtered version of the dataset called UK_by_year.
Create a line plot of the percentage of "yes" votes over time for the United Kingdom.




# Start with by_year_country dataset
by_year_country <- votes_processed %>%
  group_by(year, country) %>%
  summarize(total = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

# Print by_year_country
by_year_country

# A tibble: 4,744 x 4
# Groups:   year [34]
    year country                         total percent_yes
   <dbl> <chr>                           <int>       <dbl>
 1  1947 Afghanistan                        34       0.382
 2  1947 Argentina                          38       0.579
 3  1947 Australia                          38       0.553
 4  1947 Belarus                            38       0.5  
 5  1947 Belgium                            38       0.605
 6  1947 Bolivia, Plurinational State of    37       0.595
 7  1947 Brazil                             38       0.658
 8  1947 Canada                             38       0.605
 9  1947 Chile                              38       0.658
10  1947 Colombia                           35       0.543
# ... with 4,734 more rows




# Create a filtered version: UK_by_year
UK_by_year <- by_year_country %>%
  filter(country == "United Kingdom")

# Line plot of percent_yes over time for UK only
ggplot(UK_by_year, aes(x=year, y=percent_yes)) +
  geom_line()
  
  





















Plotting multiple countries
Plotting just one country at a time is interesting, but you really want to compare trends between countries. For example, suppose you want to compare voting trends for the United States, the UK, France, and India.

You'll have to filter to include all four of these countries and use another aesthetic (not just x- and y-axes) to distinguish the countries on the resulting visualization. Instead, you'll use the color aesthetic to represent different countries.





The by_year_country dataset you created in the last exercise is available in your workspace.

Create a filtered version of by_year_country called filtered_4_countries with just the countries listed in the editor (you may find the %in% operator useful here).
Show the trend for each of these countries on the same graph, using color to distinguish each country.


# Vector of four countries to examine
countries <- c("United States", "United Kingdom",
               "France", "India")

# Filter by_year_country: filtered_4_countries
filtered_4_countries <- by_year_country %>%
  filter(country %in% countries)

# Line plot of % yes in four countries
ggplot(filtered_4_countries, aes(x=year, y=percent_yes, color=country)) +
  geom_line()
