Sorting by percentage of "yes" votes
Now that you've summarized the dataset by country, you can start examining it and answering interesting questions.

For example, you might be especially interested in the countries that voted "yes" least often, or the ones that voted "yes" most often.




Print the by_country dataset created in the last exercise.
Use arrange() to sort the countries in ascending order of percent_yes.
Arrange the countries by the same variable, but in descending order.

arrange

Usage
arrange(.data, ...)
# S3 method for grouped_df
arrange(.data, ..., .by_group = FALSE)

Arguments
.data
A tbl. All main verbs are S3 generics and provide methods for tbl_df(), dtplyr::tbl_dt() and dbplyr::tbl_dbi().

...
Comma separated list of unquoted variable names. Use desc() to sort a variable in descending order.

.by_group
If TRUE, will sort first by grouping variable. Applies to grouped data frames only.








# You have the votes summarized by country
by_country <- votes_processed %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

# Print the by_country dataset
print(by_country)

# Sort in ascending order of percent_yes

Filtering summarized output
In the last exercise, you may have noticed that the country that voted least frequently, Zanzibar, had only 2 votes in the entire dataset. You certainly can't make any substantial conclusions based on that data!

Typically in a progressive analysis, when you find that a few of your observations have very little data while others have plenty, you set some threshold to filter them out.




Use filter() to remove from the sorted data countries that have fewer than 100 votes.



# Filter out countries with fewer than 100 votes
by_country %>%
  arrange(percent_yes) %>%
  filter(total >= 100)
  
# A tibble: 197 x 3
   country                         total percent_yes
   <chr>                           <int>       <dbl>
 1 United States                    2568       0.269
 2 Palau                             369       0.339
 3 Israel                           2380       0.341
 4 Federal Republic of Germany      1075       0.397
 5 United Kingdom                   2558       0.417
