Modeling positive sentiment
Now it's time for you to build a linear model for positive sentiment in this dataset of pop songs, just like you did for negative sentiment in the last exercise. Use the same approach and see what the results are!


Count using three arguments: song, year, and total number of words.
Use mutate() to define a new percent column that is n divided by total_words
Specify a linear model with lm() in the same way as the last exercise, but with data = positive_by_year this time.
Explore the results of the model fitting with summary().


positive_by_year <- lyric_sentiment %>%
    filter(sentiment == "positive") %>%
    # Count by song, year, and total number of words
    count(song, year, total_words) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    # Define a new column: percent
    mutate(percent = n/total_words)

# Fit a linear model with percent as the response and year as the predictor
model_positive <- lm(percent ~ year, data = positive_by_year)

# Use summary to see the results of the model fitting
summary(model_positive)

You did it! Notice how low these p-values are and which direction the slope is; positive sentiment does change significantly with year, in contrast with negative sentiment.

How is sentiment in pop songs changing over the decades?
Based on the visualizations you made and the linear modeling you explored, how is sentiment changing in this dataset of songs over time?

Fewer positive words
As years have passed, the proportion of positive words has decreased in these songs; you saw this both in the plots and the modeling.
