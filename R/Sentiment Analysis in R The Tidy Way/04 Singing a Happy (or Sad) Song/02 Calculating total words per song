Calculating total words per song
For some next steps in this analysis, you need to know the total number of words sung in each song. Use count() to count up the words per song, and then left_join() these word totals to the tidy data set. You can specify exactly which column to use when joining the two data frames if you add by = "song".

Count by song to find the word totals.
With the rename() function, change the name of the new n column to total_words.
Use left_join() to combine totals with tidy_lyrics using the song column.

totals <- tidy_lyrics %>%
  # Count by song to find the word totals for each song
  count(song) %>%
  # gives you the 'n' col
  # which we would rename
  # Rename the new column
  rename(total_words = n)

# Print totals    
totals
> totals
# A tibble: 4,341 x 2
