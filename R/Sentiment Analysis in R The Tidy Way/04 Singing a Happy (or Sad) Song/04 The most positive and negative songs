The most positive and negative songs
You have successfully implemented sentiment analysis on this dataset of song lyrics, and now you can ask question such as, "Which songs have the highest proportion of positive words? Of negative words?" You calculated the total number of words for each song earlier, so now you need to count the number of words for each sentiment and song.


Use count() with three arguments to find the number of sentiment words for each song and total number of words.
Make a new column using mutate() that is named percent, equal to n (the output of count()) divided by the total number of words.
Filter for only negative words.
Arrange by descending percent.
Now repeat these same steps for positive words.

# What songs have the highest proportion of negative words?
lyric_sentiment %>%
    # Count using three arguments
    count(song, sentiment, total_words) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    # Make a new percent column with mutate 
    mutate(percent = n/total_words) %>%
    # Filter for only negative words
    filter(sentiment == "negative") %>%
    # Arrange by descending percent
    arrange(desc(percent))
# A tibble: 4,169 x 5
