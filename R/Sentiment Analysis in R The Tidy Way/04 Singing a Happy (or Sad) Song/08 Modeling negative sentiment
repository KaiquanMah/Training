Modeling negative sentiment
You saw in your visualizations in the last exercise how positive and negative sentiment appear to be related to year. Now, you can explore that relationship with linear modeling. One more time, make a dataframe with one row per song that contains the proportion of negative words. Then, build a linear model and see whether the relationship is significant. The lyric_sentiment data frame that you created earlier is still available in your environment.

Filter for only negative words
Use mutate() to define a new percent column that is n divided by total_words
When fitting the linear model with lm(), percent will be your response and year will be your predictor.
To see the results of your model fitting, call summary on your model fit object


negative_by_year <- lyric_sentiment %>%
    # Filter for negative words
    filter(sentiment == "negative") %>%
    count(song, year, total_words) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    # Define a new column: percent
    mutate(percent = n/total_words)

# Specify the model with percent as the response and year as the predictor
model_negative <- lm(percent ~ year, data = negative_by_year)

# Use summary to see the results of the model fitting
summary(model_negative)

Great job fitting this model! Notice how high the p-values are; negative sentiment does not change significantly with year.
