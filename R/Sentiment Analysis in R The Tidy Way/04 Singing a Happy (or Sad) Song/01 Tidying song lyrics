Tidying song lyrics
Let's take a look at the dataset you will use in this final chapter to practice your sentiment analysis skills. The song_lyrics dataset contains five columns:
rank, the rank a song achieved on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100,
song, the song's title,
artist, the artist who recorded the song,
year, the year the song reached the given rank on the Billboard chart, and
lyrics, the lyrics of the song.

This dataset contains over 5000 songs, from 1965 to the present. The lyrics are all in one column, so they are not yet in a tidy format, ready for analysis using tidy tools. It's your turn to tidy this text data!
