Sentiment analysis on song lyrics
You have been practicing how to implement sentiment analysis with a join throughout this course. After transforming the text of these songs to a tidy text dataset and preparing the data frame, the resulting data frame lyric_counts is ready for you to perform sentiment analysis once again. Once you have done the sentiment analysis, you can learn which songs have the most sentiment words from the NRC lexicon. Remember that the NRC lexicon has 10 categories of sentiment:
anger
anticipation
disgust
fear
joy
negative
positive
sadness
surprise
trust


Use the correct kind of join to implement sentiment analysis.
Add the "nrc" lexicon as the argument to the join function.
Find the songs with the most sentiment words by using two arguments in count(), along with sort = TRUE.



lyric_sentiment <- lyric_counts %>%
    # Implement sentiment analysis with the "nrc" lexicon
    inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"), by="word")
