Sentiment lexicons
There are several different sentiment lexicons available for sentiment analysis. You will explore three in this course that are available in the tidytext package:
afinn from Finn Ã…rup Nielsen,
bing from Bing Liu and collaborators, and
nrc from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney.

You will see how these lexicons can be used as you work through this course. The decision about which lexicon to use often depends on what question you are trying to answer.
In this exercise, you will use dplyr's count() function. If you pass count() a variable, it will count the number of rows that share each distinct value of that variable.

Load the dplyr and tidytext packages.
Add an argument to get_sentiments() to see what the "bing" lexicon looks like.
Then call get_sentiments() for the "nrc" lexicon.
Add an argument to count() so you can see how many words the nrc lexicon has for each sentiment category.

# Load dplyr and tidytext
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)

# Choose the bing lexicon
get_sentiments("bing")

# Choose the nrc lexicon
get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  count(sentiment) # Count words by sentiment
# A tibble: 10 x 2
