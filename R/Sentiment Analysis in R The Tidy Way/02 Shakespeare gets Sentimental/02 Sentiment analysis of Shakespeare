Sentiment analysis of Shakespeare
You learned how to implement sentiment analysis with a join in the first chapter of this course. After transforming the text of these Shakespearean plays to a tidy text dataset in the last exercise, the resulting data frame tidy_shakespeare is ready for sentiment analysis with such an approach. Once you have performed the sentiment analysis, you can find out how many negative and positive words each play has with just one line of code.


Use the correct kind of join to implement sentiment analysis.
Add the "bing" lexicon as the argument to the join function.
Find how many positive and negative words each play has by using two arguments in count().

shakespeare_sentiment <- tidy_shakespeare %>%
  # Implement sentiment analysis with the "bing" lexicon
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) 
  
# A tibble: 11,584 x 5
   title                           type    linenumber word     sentiment

  count(title, sentiment)
  
# A tibble: 12 x 3

11 The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet negative   1235
12 The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet positive   1090  

Fabulous! Passing two variables to count() returns the count n for each unique combination of the two variables. In this case, you have 6 plays and 2 sentiments, so count() returns 6 x 2 = 12 rows.
