Which station uses the most positive or negative words?
You performed sentiment analysis on this dataset of TV news text, and the results are available in your environment in tv_sentiment. How do the words used when discussing climate change compare across stations? Which stations use more positive words? More negative words?


Start off by looking at negative words.
Define a new column percent using mutate() that is n divided by station_total, the proportion of words that belong to that sentiment.
Filter only for the negative sentiment rows.
Arrange by percent so you can see the results sorted by proportion of negative words.
Now repeat these steps to examine positive words!

 [1] "disgust"      "positive"     "trust"        "joy"          "fear"        
 [6] "anger"        "negative"     "sadness"      "anticipation" "surprise"
 
# Which stations use the most negative words?
tv_sentiment %>% 
    count(station, sentiment, station_total) %>%
    # Define a new column percent
    mutate(percent = n/station_total) %>%
    # Filter only for negative words
    filter(sentiment == "negative") %>%
    # Arrange by percent
    # arrange from the least # of neg words to the greatest # of neg words in ascending order
    arrange(percent)
# A tibble: 3 x 5
  station  sentiment station_total     n percent
  <chr>    <chr>             <int> <int>   <dbl>
1 MSNBC    negative          19514   526  0.0270
2 CNN      negative          10726   331  0.0309
3 FOX News negative          10887   403  0.0370



# Now do the same but for positive words
tv_sentiment %>% 
    count(station, sentiment, station_total) %>%
    mutate(percent = n/station_total) %>%
    filter(sentiment == "positive") %>%
    # arrange from the least # of pos words to the greatest # of pos words in ascending order
    arrange(percent)
# A tibble: 3 x 5
  station  sentiment station_total     n percent
  <chr>    <chr>             <int> <int>   <dbl>
1 FOX News positive          10887   514  0.0472
2 CNN      positive          10726   522  0.0487
3 MSNBC    positive          19514   953  0.0488    
    
    
Notice that MSNBC used a low proportion of negative words but a high proportion of positive words, the reverse is true of FOX News, and CNN is middle of the pack.
