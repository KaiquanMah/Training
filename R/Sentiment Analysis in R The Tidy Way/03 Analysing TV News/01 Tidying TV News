Tidying TV news
Take a look at the dataset of TV news text about climate change you will use in this chapter. The climate_text dataset contains almost 600 closed captioning snippets and four columns:
station, the TV news station where the text is from,
show, the show on that station where the text was spoken,
show_date, the broadcast date of the spoken text, and
text, the actual text spoken on TV.

Type climate_text in the console to take a look at the dataset before getting started with transforming it to a tidy format.
Load the tidytext package.
Pipe the original dataset to the next line.
Use unnest_tokens() to transform the non-tidy text data to a tidy text dataset, with a word column in the output.
