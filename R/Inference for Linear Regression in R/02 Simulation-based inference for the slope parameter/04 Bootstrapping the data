Bootstrapping the data
Using the infer package with type = "bootstrap", you can repeatedly sample from the dataset to estimate the sampling distribution and standard error of the slope coefficient. Using the sampling distribution will allow you to directly find a confidence interval for the underlying population slope.


Use the infer steps to bootstrap the twins data 1000 times. You don't have to hypothesize() because now you're creating confidence intervals, not hypothesis testing!
Specify Foster versus Biological.
Generate 1000 replicates by bootstrapping.
Calculate the slope statistic.

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(4747)

# Calculate 1000 bootstrapped slopes
boot_slope <- twins %>%
  # Specify Foster vs. Biological
  specify(Foster ~ Biological) %>%
  # Generate 1000 bootstrap replicates
  generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>%
  # Calculate the slope statistic
  calculate(stat="slope")

# See the result

Beautiful bootstrapping! Bootstrap replicates sample from the data with replacement, unlike permutation replicates.
