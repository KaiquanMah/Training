Inference on coefficients
Using the NYC Italian restaurants dataset (compiled by Simon Sheather in A Modern Approach to Regression with R), restNYC, you will investigate the effect on the significance of the coefficients when there are multiple variables in the model. Recall, the p-value associated with any coefficient is the probability of the observed data given that the particular variable is independent of the response AND given that all other variables are included in the model.

The following information relates to the dataset restNYC which is loaded into your workspace:

each row represents one customer survey from Italian restaurants in NYC
Price = price (in US$) of dinner (including tip and one drink)
Service = rating of the service (from 1 to 30)
Food = rating of the food (from 1 to 30)
Decor = rating fo the decor (from 1 to 30)




Run a tidy lm regressing Price on Service.
Run a tidy lm regressing Price on Service, Food, and Decor.
What happened to the significance of Service when additional variables were added to the model?



# Output the first model
lm(Price ~ Service, data = restNYC) %>%
  tidy()

# A tibble: 2 x 5
  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
1 (Intercept)   -12.0      5.11      -2.34 2.02e- 2
2 Service         2.82     0.262     10.8  7.88e-21





# Output the second model
lm(Price ~ Service + Food + Decor, data = restNYC) %>%
  tidy()

# A tibble: 4 x 5
  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
1 (Intercept)  -24.6       4.75     -5.18  6.33e- 7
2 Service        0.135     0.396     0.341 7.33e- 1
3 Food           1.56      0.373     4.17  4.93e- 5
4 Decor          1.85      0.218     8.49  1.17e-14



Perfect Price modeling! When only Service is included in the model, it appears significant. However, once Food and Decor are added into the model, that is no longer the case.











Interpreting coefficients
What is the correct interpretation of the coefficient on Service in the linear model which regresses Price on Service, Food, and Decor?
You will need to run the linear model before answering the question: lm(Price ~ Service + Food + Decor, data=restNYC) %>% tidy()

> lm(Price ~ Service + Food + Decor, data=restNYC) %>% tidy()
# A tibble: 4 x 5
  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
1 (Intercept)  -24.6       4.75     -5.18  6.33e- 7
2 Service        0.135     0.396     0.341 7.33e- 1
3 Food           1.56      0.373     4.17  4.93e- 5
4 Decor          1.85      0.218     8.49  1.17e-14


For every one unit increase in Service, the predicted average Price is expected to increase by 0.135.

For every one unit increase in Service, the predicted average Price is expected to increase by 0.135, given fixed values of Food and Decor.
The interpretation of the coefficient value is fine, but Service is not signficant, so you should stay away from claiming the coefficient value as interpretable.

For every one unit increase in Service, the predicted average Price is expected to increase by 0.135, for any possible value of Food and Decor.

#yes Given that Food and Decor are in the model, Service is not significant, and we cannot know whether it has effect on modeling Price.
Right, given Food and Decor are in the model, Service does not seem to have much predictive power.
