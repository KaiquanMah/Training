LA Homes, multicollinearity (1)
In the next series of exercises, you will investigate how to interpret the sign (positive or negative) of the slope coefficient as well as the significance of the variables (p-value). You will continue to use the log transformed variables so that the technical conditions hold, but you will not be concerned here with the value of the coefficient.


Run a linear regression on log price versus log sqft for the LAhomes dataset, then tidy the output.
Look at the output. Is the relationship is positive or negative? Is relationship is significant?
# Output the tidy model
lm(log(price) ~ log(sqft), data = LAhomes) %>% 
  tidy()

# A tibble: 2 x 5
  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
1 (Intercept)     2.70    0.144       18.8 1.97e-71
2 log(sqft)       1.44    0.0195      73.8 0.

The model shows that the area of the home has a significant positive relationship with the price.













LA Homes, multicollinearity (2)
Repeat the previous exercise, but this time regress the log transformed variable price on the new variable bath which records the number of bathrooms in a home.


Run a linear regression on log price versus log bath for the LAhomes dataset, then tidy the output.
Look at the output. Is the relationship is positive or negative? Is relationship is significant?

# Output the tidy model
lm(log(price) ~ log(bath), data = LAhomes) %>% 
  tidy()


# A tibble: 2 x 5
  term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value
  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
1 (Intercept)    12.2     0.0280     437.  0.       
2 log(bath)       1.43    0.0306      46.6 9.66e-300


The model shows that the number of bathrooms also has a significant positive relationship with the price of the home.
















LA Homes, multicollinearity (3)
Now, regress the log transformed variable price on the log transformed variables sqft AND bath. The model is a three dimensional linear regression model where you are predicting price as a plane (think of a piece of paper) above the axes including both sqft and bath.

Run a tidy lm on the log transformed variables price and both of sqft and bath from the dataset LAhomes. Use the formula: log(price) ~ log(sqft) + log(bath).
Now look at the coefficients separately. What happened to the signs of each of the coefficients? What happened to the significance of each of the coefficients?

# Output the tidy model
lm(log(price) ~ log(sqft) + log(bath), data = LAhomes) %>% 
  tidy()
  
# A tibble: 3 x 5
  term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value
  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
1 (Intercept)   2.51      0.262      9.60  2.96e- 21
2 log(sqft)     1.47      0.0395    37.2   1.19e-218
3 log(bath)    -0.0390    0.0453    -0.862 3.89e-  1


The model still predicts that the square footage of the home has a significant positive relationship with price. However, now the number of bathrooms no longer has a significant relationship with the price. (Note also that the sign of the coefficient has changed.)
