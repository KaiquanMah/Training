Hypothetical population - less variability around the line
In order to understand the sampling distribution associated with the slope coefficient, it is valuable to visualize the impact changes in the sample and population have on the slope coefficient. Here, reducing the variance associated with the response variable around the line changes the variability associated with the slope statistics.


Look at the plot that has been drawn for you.
Swap popdata for new_popdata in the sampling code, and redraw the plot.
Look at the new plot. How is it different?

# Update the sampling to use new_popdata
many_samples <- new_popdata %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 100)

# Rerun the plot; how does it change?
ggplot(many_samples, aes(x = explanatory, y = response, group = replicate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) 
    
Delightful dataset switching! Notice that the farther the points are from the line (the more variable the points are), the more variable the slope coefficients will be.
#Removing extreme y values led to a tighter distribution of linear regression lines.
