Hypothetical population - less variability in x direction
In order to understand the sampling distribution associated with the slope coefficient, it is valuable to visualize the impact changes in the sample and population have on the slope coefficient. Here, reducing the variance associated with the explanatory variable around the line changes the variability associated with the slope statistics.


Look at the plot that has been drawn for you.
Swap popdata for even_newer_popdata in the sampling code, and redraw the plot.
Set the x-axis limits from -17 to 17 (so they are the same as before).
Look at the new plot. How is it different?

# Update the sampling to use even_newer_popdata
many_samples <- even_newer_popdata %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 100)

# Update and rerun the plot; how does it change?
ggplot(many_samples, aes(x = explanatory, y = response, group = replicate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  # Set the x-axis limit from -17 to 17
  xlim(-17, 17)
  
Somewhat counter-intuitively, reducing the variability in the direction of the explanatory variable INCREASES the variability of the slope coefficients. This is because with a smaller range of the explanatory variable, there is less information on which to build the model.
# remove extreme x values to focus on the centre x values led to a wider variation/more variation in linear regression lines.













What changes the variability of the coefficients?
The last three exercises have demonstrated how the variability in the slope coefficient can change based on changes to the population and the sample. Which of the following combinations increases the variability in the sampling distribution of the slope coefficient?

Bigger sample size, larger variability around the line, increased range of explanatory variable.
Bigger sample size, larger variability around the line, decreased range of explanatory variable.
Smaller sample size, smaller variability around the line, increased range of explanatory variable.
Smaller sample size, smaller variability around the line, decreased range of explanatory variable.


#yes Smaller sample size, larger variability around the line, decreased range of explanatory variable.
