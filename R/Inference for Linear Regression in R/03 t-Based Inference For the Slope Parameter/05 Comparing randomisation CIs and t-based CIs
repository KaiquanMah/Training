Comparing randomisation CIs and t-based CIs
As with hypothesis testing, if technical conditions hold (technical conditions are discussed more in the next chapter), the CI created for the slope parameter in the t-distribution setting should be in line with the CI created using bootstrapping. Create a CI for the slope parameter and compare it to the one created using the bootstrap percentile interval from the previous chapter.
Note that the bootstrap and t-intervals will not be exactly the same because they use different computational steps to arrive at the interval estimate.

Calculate the confidence level and the lower and upper percentile cutoffs from alpha.
alpha <- 0.05

# Calculate the confidence level
confidence_level <- 1-alpha

# Calculate lower percentile cutoff
p_lower <- alpha/2

# ... and the upper one
p_upper <- 1-alpha/2






Tidy the linear regression model, including a confidence interval, and set the confidence level to confidence_level.
Summarize the bootstrap replicates to calculate a confidence interval using quantiles of stat. Use p_lower and p_upper for the quantiles.

# From previous step
alpha <- 0.05
confidence_level <- 1 - alpha
p_lower <- alpha / 2
p_upper <- 1 - alpha / 2

# Tidy the model, including a confidence interval
tidied_model <- lm(Foster ~ Biological, data = twins) %>% 
   tidy(conf.int=TRUE, conf.level=confidence_level) 

# Recall the t-confidence interval
tidied_model %>%
  filter(term == "Biological") %>%
  select(conf.low, conf.high)


# A tibble: 1 x 2
  conf.low conf.high
     <dbl>     <dbl>
1    0.703      1.10








# Create the bootstrap confidence interval
boot_slope %>% 
  summarize(
    lower = quantile(stat, p_lower), 
    upper = quantile(stat, p_upper)
  )
  
  

# A tibble: 1 x 2
  lower upper
  <dbl> <dbl>
1 0.724  1.08

The confidence interval is almost the same when calculated using bootstrap quantiles compared to the theoretical t-distrabution quantiles. That means that the theoretical assumptions hold up well.
