Politics and Space
While the relationship between political party and military spending is no big surprise, what about the relationship between political party and another spending priority: space exploration?
Start your exploration by simplifying the data set to include only people that identified as Republicans (Rep), Democrats (Dem), and Independents (Ind).

Create a new data set called gss_party that is gss2016 with a filter applied to remove people who responded "Oth" to party.

# Subset data
gss_party <- gss2016 %>%
  # Filter out the "Oth"
  filter(party != "Oth")






Using gss_party, construct a stacked bar plot of party filled based on natspac. Modify the geometry so that the plot displays proportions.
# Visualize distribution take 1
gss_party %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=party, fill=natspac)) +
  # Add bar layer of proportions
  geom_bar(position="fill")




Construct a second plot that illustrates the same relationship but this time, modify the plot to display counts.
# Visualize distribution take 2 
gss_party %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=party, fill=natspac)) +
  # Add bar layer of proportions
  geom_bar()


The plot of proportions makes it clear that this story here is less clear cut. While thoughts on space exploration do differ slightly from party to party, do you think this difference is significant?











Understanding contingency tables
The bar plot of counts that you constructed is a visual representation of a contingency table.
Which of the following is FALSE regarding contingency tables?

They are a common method of displaying categorical data.
They have one variable across the columns and another variable along the rows.
They should be transformed to a tidy format for analysis.

#not They have the variables across the columns and observations down the rows.
Correct! That's a description of tidy data. Contingency tables are not tidy!
