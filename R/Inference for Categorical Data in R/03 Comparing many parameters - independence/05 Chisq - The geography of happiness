Checking conditions
There are three new data sets in your environment, ds1, ds2, and ds3, that all contain two columns of categorical data. You can test the independence of the two variables for all three data sets using a permutation chi-squared test, however the chi-squared approximation method will only be accurate for one of them. Which one?
Note: since these data sets only have two columns, you can form a contingency table by simply running table() on the original data frame.

> table(ds1)
    var2
var1  X  Y
   A 10 12
   B 14 10

df = (2-1)*(2-1) = 1*1 = 1
#df is < 2 

> table(ds2)
    var2
var1  X  Y  Z
   A  8 12  2
   B 15  2  7
   C  4  5  2

df = (3-1)*(3-1) = 2*2 = 4
#df is >=2 
#yet Some of these cell counts are very low and would correspond to expected counts less than 5.



> table(ds3)
    var2
var1  X  Y  Z
   A 14 11 22
   B 28 20 14

df = (2-1)*(3-1) = 1*2 = 2
#df is >=2
#cell counts are >= 5
#You can expect your chi-squared approximation to provide you with accurate p-values in this setting.














The geography of happiness
In addition to information regarding their opinions on policy issues, GSS survey respondents also provided the region of the United States in which they live. With this in hand, you can explore the question:
Does this data set provide evidence of an association between happiness and geography?

Using gss2016,construct a bar plot of proportions capturing the relationship between region and happy. Plots like this are easier to read when the variable with the fewer number of levels is mapped to fill.
Use chisq_stat() to compute the observed chi-squared statistic associated with this bar plot and save it as chi_obs.
#normal bar chart
# Visualize distribution of region and happy
ggplot(gss2016, aes(x=region, fill=happy)) +
  # Add bar layer of proportions
  geom_bar()



#stacked bar chart
# Visualize distribution of region and happy
ggplot(gss2016, aes(x=region, fill=happy)) +
  # Add bar layer of proportions
  geom_bar(position = "fill")


# Calculate and save observed statistic
chi_obs <- gss2016 %>%
  chisq_stat(happy ~ region)

# See the result
chi_obs
[1] 0.2547647

It seems that there were a good number of happy midwesterners in this sample. Do you think this effect exists in the greater population?
