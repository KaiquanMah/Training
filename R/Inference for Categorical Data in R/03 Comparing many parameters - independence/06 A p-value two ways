A p-value two ways
In this exercise you'll find out if the observed chi-squared statistic is unusually large under the following notion that,
H0: Region is independent of Happy.
The competing notion is the alternative hypothesis that there is an association between these variables. For the sake of comparison, you'll be finding the p-value first from the computational approach, then use the approximation.

Generate a distribution of the "Chisq" statistic under a null hypothesis of independence between happy and region. Save this object to null.
> unique(gss2016$region)
[1] central  eastern  mountain pacific 
Levels: pacific eastern central mountain

> unique(gss2016$happy)
[1] HAPPY   UNHAPPY
Levels: HAPPY UNHAPPY

df = (4-1)*(2-1) = 3*1 = 3


# Generate null distribution
null <- gss2016 %>%
  # Specify variables
  specify(happy ~ region, success = "HAPPY") %>%
  # Set up null
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  # Generated 500 permuted data sets
  generate(reps = 500, type = "permute") %>%
  # Calculate statistics
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")




Create a density plot of null, add a vertical red line at chi_obs, and overlay the corresponding approximation from the Chi-squared distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom.
>   chi_obs
[1] 0.2547647

# Visualize null
ggplot(null, aes(x = stat)) +
  # Add density layer
  geom_density() +
  # Add red vertical line at obs stat
  geom_vline(xintercept=chi_obs, color="red") +
  # Overlay chisq approximation
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = 3), color = "blue")







Compute the permutation p-value.
Compute the approximation p-value. Recall that pchisq() will return the left tail of the distribution. To return the right tail, add an argument lower.tail = FALSE.
# Calculate computational pval
null %>%
  summarize(pval = mean(stat >= chi_obs))
# A tibble: 1 x 1
   pval
  <dbl>
1 0.974





# Calculate approximate pval
pchisq(chi_obs, df = 3, lower.tail = FALSE)
[1] 0.9682987


Potent p-values! Although they are very similar here, you'd be slightly better off using your computational p-value. The approximation becomes less accurate when cell counts are low, as they are here.
