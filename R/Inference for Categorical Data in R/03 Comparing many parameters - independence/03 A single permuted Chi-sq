A single permuted Chi-sq
The key to generating data under a null hypothesis of independence is permutation. Generate just a single data set to see what sort of chi-squared statistic you might observe when in fact these two variables are independent of one another.


Using gss_party, first specify that you'd like to study natarms as a function of party, create a null hypothesis of independence, then generate a single data set via permutation. Save this as perm_1.
# Create one permuted data set
perm_1 <- gss_party %>%
  # Specify the variables of interest
  specify(natarms ~ party) %>%
  # Set up the null
  hypothesize(null="independence") %>%
  # Generate a single permuted data set
  generate(reps=1, type="permute")







Using perm_1, visualize the relationship between natarms and party by constructing a stacked bar plot of counts.
# Visualize permuted data
ggplot(perm_1, aes(x=party, fill=natarms)) +
  # Add bar layer
  geom_bar()





Calculate the chi-squared test statistic associated with by running the gss_party data through the chisq_stat() function and specifying the variables using the formula notation as you did in specify().

chisq_stat
Tidy Chi-Squared Test Statistic
A shortcut wrapper function to get the observed test statistic for a chisq test. Uses chisq.test(), which applies a continuity correction.

Usage
chisq_stat(x, formula, response = NULL, explanatory = NULL, ...)

Arguments
x
A data frame that can be coerced into a tibble.

formula
A formula with the response variable on the left and the explanatory on the right.

response
The variable name in x that will serve as the response. This is alternative to using the formula argument.

explanatory
The variable name in x that will serve as the explanatory variable.

...
Additional arguments for chisq.test().



# Compute chi-squared stat
gss_party %>%
  chisq_stat(natarms ~ party)

By permuting or shuffling one of the variables, you have generated a new data set (with an associated chi-squared statistic) under the null hypothesis that these variables are unrelated.
