CI via approximation
The approximation shortcut offers an alternative method of describing the sampling distribution. In this exercise, you will apply the approximation shortcut to build a confidence interval for the proportion of respondents that live in the pacific region.
When building any confidence interval, note that you use three ingredients: the point estimate (here, p_hat), the SE, and the number of standard errors to add and subtract. For a sampling distribution that is bell-shaped, adding and subtracting two SEs corresponds to a confidence level of 95%. When you use the bootstrap, you can check that the distribution is bell-shaped because you have a have the bootstrap distribution to plot. When you use the approximation, you're flying blind – well, not quite blind, but you are dependent on the "rule of thumb" to ensure that you're working with a bell shape.

Calculate the sample size, n (which is the number of rows).
Calculated the observed statistic, p_hat, as the proportion of people in the "pacific" meta-region.

Check the rules-of-thumb for the normal distribution being a decent approximation.
Calculate the standard error using the approximation formula p^×(1−p^)n−−−−−−√.
Use SE_approx to form a confidence interval for p_hat. The limits should be two standard errors either side of p_hat.
# Check conditions
n * p_hat >= 10
[1] TRUE

n * (1 - p_hat) >= 10
[1] TRUE


# Calculate SE
SE_approx <- sd(p_hat)
> SE_approx
[1] 0.0244949

# Form 95% CI
c(p_hat-2*SE_approx, p_hat+2*SE_approx)
[1] 0.05101021 0.14898979

You probably noticed: this approximation method gives you a similar answer to the computational approach. This is a recurring theme that you'll be seeing throughout this course.









Methods compared
Now you have seen two ways to construct a confidence interval for a proportion. Which of the following about the two methods is true?

Once the rule-of-thumb condition is violated, the approximation method instantly becomes extremely inaccurate.
In traditional surveys and scientific research, the bootstrap approach is more commonly used than the approximation approach.

#yes At a very small sample size, both approaches will perform poorly. Inference on very small data sets is not recommended!
