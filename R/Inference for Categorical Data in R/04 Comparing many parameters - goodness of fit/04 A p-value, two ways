A p-value, two ways
You've seen before how there are usually two ways to get to the null distribution: through computation and through a mathematical approximation. The chi-squared goodness of fit test is no exception. The approximation distribution is again the "Chi-squared distribution" with degrees of freedom equal to the number of categories minus one.
In this exercise you'll compare these two approaches to calculate a p-value that measures the consistency of the distribution of the Iran first digits with Benford's Law. Note that the observed statistic that you created in the last exercise is saved in your work space as chi_obs_stat.

Compute the degrees of freedom of the chi-squared approximation by taking the first_digit vector from the iran data then calculating the number of categories using the nlevels() function then subtracting one.
Using null, plot the distribution of the chi-squared statistics using a density plot. Add a vertical line indicating the observed statistic, then overlay the curve of the chi-squared approximation with the degrees of freedom in blue.
# Compute degrees of freedom
degrees_of_freedom <- iran %>%
  # Pull out first_digit vector
  pull("first_digit") %>% 
  # Calculate n levels and subtract 1
  nlevels() - 1
[1] 8


# Plot both null dists
ggplot(null, aes(x=stat)) +
  # Add density layer
  geom_density() +
  # Add vertical line at obs stat
  geom_vline(xintercept=chi_obs_stat, color="red") +
  # Overlay chisq approx
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = degrees_of_freedom), color = "blue")



Compute the permutation p-value by summarizing the statistics with the proportion that are greater than the observed statistic.
Compute the approximation p-value using the pchisq() function. Recall that this will return the area under the curve to the left of the observed value, so you'll need to modify it to return the right tail.
# Permutation p-value
null %>%
  summarize(pval = mean(stat >= chi_obs_stat))
# A tibble: 1 x 1
   pval
  <dbl>
1  0.01
  
  
# Approximation p-value
pchisq(chi_obs_stat,df=degrees_of_freedom,lower.tail=FALSE)
  X-squared 
0.006836367

Potent p-values! Although they are very similar here, you'd be slightly better off using your computational p-value. The approximation becomes less accurate when cell counts are low, as they are here.


















Is this evidence of fraud?
Based on your p-value of approximately 0.006, which of the following statements is FALSE?

#not If the null hypothesis is true, the probability of observing a test statistic more extreme than the observed statistic is 0.006.
Nope, this one is true. This is the definition of a p-value.

#not Benford's law has been suggested to apply to first digit counts from fair elections.
#not The p-value is a measure of the consistency between a data set and a particular hypothesis.

#yes This data is inconsistent with a model in which Benford's law applies to vote totals from the 2009 Iranian election.
Bingo! The low p-value suggests this data is inconsistent with the proportions expected by Benford's Law.
