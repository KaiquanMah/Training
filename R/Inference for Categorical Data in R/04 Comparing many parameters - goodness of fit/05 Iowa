Getting to know the Iowa data
This exercise should feel familiar: introducing yourself to the dataset by acquainting yourself with its basic structure. Questions that you should be thinking about include: What do the rows refer to? What about the columns? What type of data to they contain? How does this compare to the iran data?
After you've familiarized yourself with the iowa data, determine which of the following statements is FALSE.

There are 1386 observations on 5 variables.
Each row refers to candidate pair (President/Vice President) in a single county.
There appear to be 14 distinct categories in the candidate column.

#false The columns contain the name of the office, the candidate, the party, the county, and the votes cast, all of which are categorical data.
Well done! Most, but not all, of those variables are categorical. Votes cast is numerical.

Extracting the first digit II
There are different levels at which we could consider looking at vote totals. We could look at precincts, or counties, or states, and each level might give us a slightly different picture of what's going on.
For this analysis, look at totals at the county level in Iowa and focus on the votes for the two major party candidates: Republicans Trump / Pence and Democrats Clinton / Kaine.

Using the iowa data set, filter the rows so they contain only the two main party candidates, then group based on county and add up the votes to create a new column called dem_rep_votes. Save the resulting data frame to iowa_county.
# Get Iowa county vote totals
iowa_county <- iowa %>%
  # Filter for rep/dem
  filter(candidate %in% c("Donald Trump / Mike Pence", "Hillary Clinton / Tim Kaine")) %>%
  # Group by county
  group_by(county) %>%
  # Compute total votes in each county
  summarise(dem_rep_votes = sum(votes))
  
# See the result
iowa_county
# A tibble: 99 x 2
   county     dem_rep_votes
   <chr>              <dbl>
 1 Adair               3594
 2 Adams               1960
 3 Allamakee           6514
 4 Appanoose           5847
 5 Audubon             3216
 6 Benton             12910
 7 Black Hawk         59709
 8 Boone              13025
 9 Bremer             12564
10 Buchanan            9480
# ... with 89 more rows










Extract the first digit from the dem_rep_votes column using the custom function, call it first_digit, and save it back over iowa_county.
# Add first_digit
iowa_county <- iowa_county %>%
  mutate(first_digit = get_first(dem_rep_votes))
  
# See the result
iowa_county



Construct a bar plot of first_digit.
# Using iowa_county, plot first_digit
ggplot(iowa_county, aes(x=first_digit)) +
  # Add bar layer
  geom_bar()

Now you have another distribution of first digits. How does this compare to Iran? How does this compare to Benford's Law?
