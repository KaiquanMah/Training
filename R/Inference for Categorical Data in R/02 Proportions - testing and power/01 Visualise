Life after death
In this chapter, you'll continue to dig into the data from the General Social Survey. One of the questions that was asked of respondents was: "Do you believe there is a life after death?"
Let's see how your sample of Americans responded to this question in 2016.

Using gss2016, visualize the distribution of postlife as a bar plot.
# Using `gss2016`, plot postlife
ggplot(gss2016, aes(x=postlife)) +
  # Add bar layer
  geom_bar()

Compute the proportion of respondents that do believe in life after death and save it has p_hat.
# Calculate and save proportion that believe
p_hat <- gss2016 %>%
  summarize(prop_yes = mean(postlife == "YES")) %>%
  pull()

# See the result
p_hat


[1] 0.8
Your sample of data has a majority of respondents that indeed believe in an afterlife.
