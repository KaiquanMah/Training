Testing a claim
In the last exercise, you got a sense of what a single simulated p-hat might be if in fact the true proportion of believers was 0.75. That p-hat was likely different from the p-hat in gss2016, but was that a fluke or is there a systematic inconsistency between that claim and the data in the GSS?
In this exercise, you'll settle this question.

Extend your code for the last exercise to calculate() sample proportions of believers in 500 generated data sets. Save this collection of p-hats to null.
# Generate null distribution
null <- gss2016 %>%
  specify(response = postlife, success = "YES") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.75) %>%
  generate(reps = 500, type = "simulate") %>%
  # Calculate proportions
  calculate(stat = "prop")



Visualize the null distribution by creating a density plot of the statistics. Using geom_vline(), add a vertical line at the value of p_hat (from the last exercise), colored "red".
# Visualize null distribution
ggplot(null, aes(x=stat)) +
  # Add density layer
  geom_density() +
  # Add line at observed
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_hat, color = "red")



Compute the one-tailed p-value by finding the proportion of null values that are greater than or equal to your observed p_hat.
Compute the two-tailed p-value (where the proportion of null values is equal to or more extreme than the observed p_hat) from this by multiplying by 2.
> null %>%
    summarise(
      # Compute the one-tailed p-value
      one_tailed_pval = mean(stat >= p_hat))
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  one_tailed_pval
            <dbl>
1           0.072





null %>%
  summarise(
    # Compute the one-tailed p-value
    one_tailed_pval = mean(stat >= p_hat),
    # Compute the two-tailed p-value
    two_tailed_pval = 2*one_tailed_pval
  ) %>%
  pull(two_tailed_pval)
[1] 0.144


One way to think about a p-value is as a measure of how far out an observed statistic is into the tails of a null distribution.


















Making a decision
It's common practice to conclude a hypothesis test by making a binary decision about the validity of the null hypothesis. Using an alpha level of .05, what is your decision regarding the null hypothesis?

Remember, you can compute p-value by running this code in the console:
null %>%
  summarize(pval = 2 * mean(stat > p_hat)) %>%
  pull()

The p-value < alpha, thus the data is consistent with the null hypothesis so I fail to reject it as a reasonable explanation.
The p-value < alpha, thus the data is inconsistent with the null hypothesis so I reject it as a reasonable explanation.
The p-value > alpha, thus the data is inconsistent with the null hypothesis so I reject it as a reasonable explanation.

#yes The p-value > alpha, thus the data is consistent with the null hypothesis so I fail to reject it as a reasonable explanation.
Great! This data is consistent with a model in which Â¾ of Americans believe in life after death.
