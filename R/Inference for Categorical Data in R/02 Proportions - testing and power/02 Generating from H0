Generating from H0
Imagine that when reading the newspaper, you come across someone who makes the following claim: "3/4 of all Americans believe in life after death". This can be interpreted as a point null hypothesis that the population proportion has a value of 0.75.
Use this hypothesis to generate a single data set to explore.

Using gss2016,
Specify the variable of interest and what constitutes a success.
Form a "point" null hypothesis that the true proportion is 0.75.
Generate a single simulated data set under this null hypothesis.
# Generate one data set under H0
sim1 <- gss2016 %>%
  # Specify the response and success
  specify(response = postlife , success = "YES") %>%
  # Hypothesize the null value of p
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.75) %>%
  # Generate a single simulated dataset
  generate(reps = 1, type = "simulate")

# See the result
sim1
Response: postlife (factor)
Null Hypothesis: point
# A tibble: 150 x 2
# Groups:   replicate [1]
   postlife replicate
   <fct>    <fct>    
 1 YES      1        
 2 YES      1        
 3 YES      1        
 4 YES      1        
 5 YES      1        
 6 NO       1        
 7 YES      1        
 8 NO       1        
 9 YES      1        
10 NO       1        
# ... with 140 more rows






Using sim1, construct a bar plot to visualize the distribution of postlife.
# Using sim1, plot postlife
ggplot(sim1, aes(x=postlife)) +
  # Add bar layer
  geom_bar()







Compute the proportion of simulated respondents in sim1 that believe in life after death.
# Compute proportion that believe
sim1 %>%
  summarise(prop_yes = mean(postlife == "YES")) %>%
  pull()
[1] 0.7733333

Spectacular simulation! The null hypothesis describes a theoretical world and with these tools, you can generate from that world as much data as you like.
