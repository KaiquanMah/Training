Interpreting correlation in context
Recall that you previously determined the value of the correlation coefficient between the poverty rate of counties in the United States and the high school graduation rate in those counties was -0.681. Choose the correct interpretation of this value.

#not People who graduate from high school are less likely to be poor.
#not Counties with lower high school graduation rates are likely to have lower poverty rates.

#yes Counties with lower high school graduation rates are likely to have higher poverty rates.

#not Because the correlation is negative, there is no relationship between poverty rates and high school graduate rates.
#not Having a higher percentage of high school graduates in a county results in that county having lower poverty rates.





Correlation and causation
In the San Francisco Bay Area from 1960-1967, the correlation between the birthweight of 1,236 babies and the length of their gestational period was 0.408. Which of the following conclusions is not a valid statistical interpretation of these results.

#valid We observed that babies with longer gestational periods tended to be heavier at birth.
#valid It may be that a longer gestational period contributes to a heavier birthweight among babies, but a randomized, controlled experiment is needed to confirm this observation.

#not valid Staying in the womb longer causes babies to be heavier when they are born.
Right! Correlation does not imply causation!

#valid These data suggest that babies with longer gestational periods tend to be heavier at birth, but there are many potential confounding factors that were not taken into account.
