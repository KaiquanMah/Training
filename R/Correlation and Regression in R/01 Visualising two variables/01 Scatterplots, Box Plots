Scatterplots
Scatterplots are the most common and effective tools for visualizing the relationship between two numeric variables.
The ncbirths dataset is a random sample of 1,000 cases taken from a larger dataset collected in 2004. Each case describes the birth of a single child born in North Carolina, along with various characteristics of the child (e.g. birth weight, length of gestation, etc.), the child's mother (e.g. age, weight gained during pregnancy, smoking habits, etc.) and the child's father (e.g. age). You can view the help file for these data by running ?ncbirths in the console.

# Scatterplot of weight vs. weeks
ggplot(ncbirths, aes(x=weeks, y=weight)) +
  geom_point()



Boxplots as discretized/conditioned scatterplots
If it is helpful, you can think of boxplots as scatterplots for which the variable on the x-axis has been discretized.
The cut() function takes two arguments: the continuous variable you want to discretize and the number of breaks that you want to make in that continuous variable in order to discretize it.
Using the ncbirths dataset again, make a boxplot illustrating how the birth weight of these babies varies according to the number of weeks of gestation. This time, use the cut() function to discretize the x-variable into six intervals (i.e. five breaks).


# Boxplot of weight vs. weeks
ggplot(data = ncbirths, 
       aes(x = cut(weeks, breaks = 5), y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
