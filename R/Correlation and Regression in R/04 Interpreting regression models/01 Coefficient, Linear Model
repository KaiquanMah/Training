Interpretation of coefficients
Recall that the fitted model for the poverty rate of U.S. counties as a function of high school graduation rate is:
povertyˆ = 64.594 − 0.591⋅hs_grad
Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the slope coefficient?

Among U.S. counties, each additional percentage point increase in the high school graduation rate is associated with about a 0.591 percentage point decrease in the poverty rate.




Interpretation in context
A politician interpreting the relationship between poverty rates and high school graduation rates implores his constituents:
If we can lower the poverty rate by 59%, we'll double the high school graduate rate in our county (i.e. raise it by 100%).
Which of the following mistakes in interpretation has the politician made?

Implying that the regression model establishes a cause-and-effect relationship.
Switching the role of the response and explanatory variables.
Confusing percentage change with percentage point change.
#yes All of the above.
None of the above.







Fitting simple linear models
While the geom_smooth(method = "lm") function is useful for drawing linear models on a scatterplot, it doesn't actually return the characteristics of the model. As suggested by that syntax, however, the function that creates linear models is lm(). This function generally takes two arguments:
A formula that specifies the model
A data argument for the data frame that contains the data you want to use to fit the model
The lm() function return a model object having class "lm". This object contains lots of information about your regression model, including the data used to fit the model, the specification of the model, the fitted values and residuals, etc.

Using the bdims dataset, create a linear model for the weight of people as a function of their height.
Using the mlbBat10 dataset, create a linear model for SLG as a function of OBP.
Using the mammals dataset, create a linear model for the body weight of mammals as a function of their brain weight, after taking the natural log of both variables.

# Linear model for weight as a function of height
lm(wgt ~ hgt, data = bdims)
Coefficients:
(Intercept)          hgt  
   -105.011        1.018
   
   
# Linear model for SLG as a function of OBP
lm(SLG ~ OBP, data = mlbBat10)
Coefficients:
(Intercept)          OBP  
   0.009407     1.110323
   
   
# Log-linear model for body weight as a function of brain weight
lm(log(BodyWt) ~ log(BrainWt), data = mammals)
 (Intercept)  log(BrainWt)  
      -2.509         1.225















Units and scale
In the previous examples, we fit two regression models:
wgtˆ = −105.011 + 1.018⋅hgt
and
SLGˆ = 0.009 + 1.110⋅OBP.

Which of the following statements is incorrect?

#not A person who is 170 cm tall is expected to weigh about 68 kg.
#yes incorrect Because the slope coefficient for OBP is larger (1.110) than the slope coefficient for hgt (1.018), we can conclude that the association between OBP and SLG is stronger than the association between height and weight.
#association is based on correlation and not the size of the coefficient

#not None of the above.
