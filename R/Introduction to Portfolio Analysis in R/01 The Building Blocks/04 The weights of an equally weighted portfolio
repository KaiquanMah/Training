One of the most commonly used portfolios in investing is the equally weighted portfolio. This means that you choose to invest an equal amount of capital in each asset.

Suppose a portfolio is equally invested in N assets, where N <- 100. Use the R console to determine which of the following commands defines the weight vector for an equally weighted portfolio.


Possible Answers

NOT     weights <- 1/N
Not quite! This creates a vector of one value!

YES     weights <- rep(1/N,N)
That's right! This creates a vector of length N (100 in this case) where each value is the same!


weights <- rep(N, 1)

weights <- rep(1/N, 1)
