The simple return  expresses the percentage change in the value of an investment. The corresponding so-called "gross" return is defined as the future value of 1 USD invested in the asset for one period and 
is thus equal to 1+R.

The gross return over two periods is obtained similarly. Let $R1$ be the return in the first period and $R2$ the return in the second period. 
Then the end-value of a 1 USD investment is (1+R1) x (1+R2).

The corresponding simple return over those two periods is: (1+R1) x (1+R2) - 1

Suppose that you have an investment horizon of two periods. In the first period, you make a 10% return. But in the second period, you take a loss of 5%.

Use the R console to compute the end value of a 1000 USD investment.
