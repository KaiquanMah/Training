It is important to be aware of the fact that a positive and negative return of the same relative magnitude do not compensate each other in terms of terminal wealth. 
Mathematically, this can be seen from the identity 
(1 + x) x (1 - x) = 1 - x^2, 
which is less than one. 
A 50% loss is thus not compensated by a 50% gain. After a loss of 50%, what is the return needed to be at par again? Verify your answer in the R console.

Well done! After 50% loss you would need to double the amount of money you have remaining to return to your initial investment value.
