This exercise will show the effect of increasing your target return on the volatility of your mean-variance efficient portfolio.

The function portfolio.optim has arguments that allow for more general specifications. 
The arguments are as follows:
portfolio.optim(x, 
                pm = mean(x),
                shorts = FALSE,
                reshigh = NULL)
http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tseries/functions/portfolio.optim

The argument pm sets the target return, 
the argument reshigh specifies the upper constraints on the portfolio weights,
and the argument shorts is a logical statement specifying whether negative weights are forbidden or not,
by default shorts = FALSE.

You will create a portfolio that is optimized for a target return that equals the average value of the return series returns. Then you will create a portfolio that has a target return that is 10% higher than the mean return series and calculate the proportion change in risk.




Create a portfolio using returns where the target return is the mean of returns. Store the output as the variable pf_mean.
Create a portfolio using returns where the target return is 10% greater than the mean of returns. Call this pf_10plus.
Print the standard deviations of both pf_mean and pf_10plus (2 lines of code). Remember that the portfolio standard deviation is stored in $ps.
Calculate the proportion increase in standard deviation you get by increasing your target return.




# Create portfolio with target return of average returns 
pf_mean <- portfolio.optim(returns, 
                           pm = mean(returns))
                           
                           
                           
# Create portfolio with target return 10% greater than average returns
pf_10plus <- portfolio.optim(returns, 
                             pm = 1.1 * mean(returns))
                             
                             
                             
# Print the standard deviations of both portfolios
pf_mean$ps
[1] 0.0355865

pf_10plus$ps
[1] 0.03842654




# Calculate the proportion increase in standard deviation
(pf_10plus$ps - pf_mean$ps) / (pf_mean$ps)
[1] 0.07980684


By increasing your target return, your portfolio's volatility increased by 8%!
