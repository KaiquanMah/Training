Identify type of study: Reading speed and font
A study is designed to evaluate whether people read text faster in Arial or Helvetica font. A group of volunteers who agreed to be a part of the study are randomly assigned to two groups: one where they read some text in Arial, and another where they read the same text in Helvetica. At the end, average reading speeds from the two groups are compared.
What type of study is this?

#not Observational study

#yes Experiment
Awesome! Even though participants are volunteers, this is still an experiment!

#not Neither, since the sample consists of volunteers










Identify type of study: Countries
Next, let's take a look at data from a different study on country characteristics. First, load the data and view it, then identify the type of study. Remember, an experiment requires random assignment.


Load the gapminder data. This dataset comes from the gapminder R package, which has already been loaded.
View the variables in the dataset with glimpse().
If these data come from an observational study, assign "observational" to the type_of_study variable. If experimental, assign "experimental".

# Identify type of study: observational or experimental
type_of_study <- "observational"



Right! Since there is no way to randomly assign countries to attributes, this is an observational study. Nice work!
