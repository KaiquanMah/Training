Random sampling or random assignment?
One of the early studies linking smoking and lung cancer compared patients who are already hospitalized with lung cancer to similar patients without lung cancer (hospitalized for other reasons), and recorded whether each patient smoked. Then, proportions of smokers for patients with and without lung cancer were compared.
Does this study employ random sampling and/or random assignment?

#not Both random sampling and random assignment
#not Random sampling, but not random assignment
#not Random assignment, but not random sampling

#yes Neither random sampling nor random assignment
Random assignment is not employed because the conditions are not imposed on the patients by the people conducting the study; random sampling is not employed because the study records the patients who are already hospitalized, so it wouldn't be appropriate to apply the findings back to the population as a whole.
# you did not assign people to have the condition
# you also did not sample between people at different hospitals OR hospitalised vs non-hospitalied people
# instead you obtained a "convenient sample" of people available for your study around your vicinity







Identify the scope of inference of study
Volunteers were recruited to participate in a study where they were asked to type 40 bits of trivia—for example, "an ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain"—into a computer. A randomly selected half of these subjects were told the information would be saved in the computer; the other half were told the items they typed would be erased.
Then, the subjects were asked to remember these bits of trivia, and the number of bits of trivia each subject could correctly recall were recorded. It was found that the subjects were significantly more likely to remember information if they thought they would not be able to find it later.
The results of the study ___ be generalized to all people and a causal link between believing information is stored and memory ___ be inferred based on these results.

#yes cannot, can
There is no random sampling since the subjects of the study were volunteers, so the results cannot be generalized to all people. However, due to random assignment, we are able to infer a causal link between the belief information is stored and the ability to recall that same information.
#randomly assigned - therefore causal
