Create a scatterplot
The bty_avg variable shows the average beauty rating of the professor by the six students who were asked to rate the attractiveness of these faculty. The score variable shows the average professor evaluation score, with 1 being very unsatisfactory and 5 being excellent.
Use ggplot() to create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between these two variables.
How would you describe the relationship apparent in this visualization?

ggplot(evals, aes(x=bty_avg, y=score)) +
  geom_point()

Create a scatterplot, with an added layer
Suppose you are interested in evaluating how the relationship between a professor's attractiveness and their evaluation score varies across different class types (small, midsize, and large).
Recreate your visualization from the previous exercise, but this time coloring the points by class type.
How would you describe the relationship apparent in this visualization?

# Scatterplot of score vs. bty_avg colored by cls_type
ggplot(evals, aes(x=bty_avg, y=score, color=cls_type)) +
  geom_point()
