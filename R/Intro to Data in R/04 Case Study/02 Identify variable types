Identify variable types
It's always useful to start your exploration of a dataset by identifying variable types. The results from this exercise will help you design appropriate visualizations and calculate useful summary statistics later in your analysis.


Explore the evals data once again with the following goals in mind: (1) Identify each variable as numerical or categorical. (2) If numerical, determine if it is discrete or continuous. (3) If categorical, determine if it is ordinal or not.
We've created a vector of variable names in the editor called cat_vars. To test your understanding of the data, remove the names of any variables that are not categorical.

# Inspect variable types
glimpse(evals)


# Remove non-factor variables from the vector below
# cols c("score", "rank", "ethnicity", "gender", "language", "age",
#              "cls_students", "cls_level", "cls_profs", "cls_credits",
#              "bty_avg", "pic_outfit", "pic_color")
cat_vars <- c("rank", "ethnicity", "gender", "language", "cls_level", "cls_profs", "cls_credits","pic_outfit", "pic_color")














Recode a variable
The cls_students variable in evals tells you the number of students in the class. Suppose instead of the exact number of students, you're interested in whether the class is
"small" (18 students or fewer),
"midsize" (19 - 59 students), or
"large" (60 students or more).

Recode the cls_students variable into a new variable, cls_type, using case_when(). This new variable should have three levels as described above. Save the resulting data frame (with the new variable) as evals.
What type of variable is cls_type?


#method 1
# Recode cls_students as cls_type
evals_fortified <- evals %>%
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      cls_students <= 18 ~ "small",
      cls_students >18 & cls_students < 60 ~ "midsize",
      cls_students >= 60 ~ "large"
    )
  )

The cls_type variable is a categorical variable, stored as a character vector. You could have made it a factor variable by wrapping the nested ifelse() statements inside factor(). You don't have to do that now. Let's move on!


#method 2
evals_fortified <- evals %>%
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      cls_students < 19 ~ "small",
      cls_students < 60 ~ "midsize",
      cls_students >= 60 ~ "large"
    )
  )
