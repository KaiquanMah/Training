Sampling strategies, determine which
A consulting company is planning a pilot study on marketing in Boston. They identify the zip codes that make up the greater Boston area, then sample 50 randomly selected addresses from each zip code and mail a coupon to these addresses. They then track whether the coupon was used in the following month.
What sampling strategy has this company used?

#not Simple random sample

#yes Stratified sample
# each zip code within Boston = 1 stratum
# randomly select 50 samples within each stratum

#not Cluster sample
The company isn't sampling all the houses in each zip code.

#not Multistage sample
The company is sampling 50 addresses from each zip code [i.e. stratified sampling], not sampling 50 addresses from a sample of zip codes [i.e. multistage sampling].





Sampling strategies, choose worst
A school district has requested a survey be conducted on the socioeconomic status of their students. Their budget only allows them to conduct the survey in some of the schools, hence they need to first sample a few schools.
Students living in this district generally attend a school in their neighborhood. The district is broken into many distinct and unique neighborhoods, some including large single-family homes and others with only low-income housing.
Which approach would likely be the least effective for selecting the schools where the survey will be conducted?

#not least effective - Simple random sampling
#not least effective - Stratified sampling, where each stratum is a neighborhood

#least effective - Cluster sampling, where each cluster is a neighborhood
This sampling strategy would be a bad idea because each neighborhood has a unique socioeconomic status. A good study would collect information about every neighborhood.
