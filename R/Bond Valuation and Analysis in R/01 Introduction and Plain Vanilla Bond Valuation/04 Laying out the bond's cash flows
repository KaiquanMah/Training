In the next set of exercises, you'll build a cash flow data frame as seen in the previous video.

Suppose you are considering investing in a bond that has a $100 par value, 5% coupon rate, and 5 years to maturity. The coupon rate is the interest that you earn from holding the bond, so prior to the bond's maturity you would receive $5 of coupon payments each year. At maturity, you will also receive the $100 par value back.

In this exercise, you will create a vector cf that lays out this bond's cash flows. You will then convert this vector into a data frame, so you can add additional columns of data required in subsequent analyses.


Create vector cf that contains the bond's cash flows. Remember that cash flows are $5 for the first 4 years and $105 in the 5th year.
Use data.frame() to convert cf into a data frame.



# Create vector of cash flows
cf <- c(5,5,5,5,105)
cf
[1]   5   5   5   5 105



# Convert to data frame
cf <- data.frame(cf)
cf
   cf
1   5
2   5
3   5
4   5
5 105



This very basic cf object represents the first step towards a more robust bond valuation model. In the next exercise, you'll expand this data frame to include additional information.
