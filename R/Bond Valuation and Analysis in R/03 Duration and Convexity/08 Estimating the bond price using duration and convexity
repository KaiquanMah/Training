In an earlier exercise, you calculated the dollar change due to duration of 8.5459 and convexity of 0.5826. You stored these two values in duration_dollar_change and convexity_dollar_change, respectively.

Recall that the price of the bond is $100, which is stored in the object px. In this exercise, you will be asked to calculate the estimated change in price based on duration and convexity and calculate the estimated new price of the bond when yields decrease by 1%.

Suppose you know that the bond's duration leads to a price effect of 8.5459, which we will store in the object duration_dollar_change. Suppose we also know that the bond's convexity leads to a price effect of 0.5826, which we will store in the object convexity_dollar_change. In this exercise, you will add the duration and convexity effects to arrive at the estimated bond price.


Estimate change in price (price_change) due to duration and convexity. To do this, combine the duration_dollar_change with convexity_dollar_change.
Estimate price based on duration and convexity. This formula should have similarities to your formula for price_change, but should incorporate the bond's current price (px).



>duration_dollar_change
[1] 8.5459
>convexity_dollar_change
[1] 0.5826
>px
[1] 100



# Estimate change in price
price_change <- duration_dollar_change + convexity_dollar_change
>price_change
[1] 9.1285



# Estimate price
price <- px + duration_dollar_change + convexity_dollar_change
>price
[1] 109.1285



You've now written code to calculate many of the important qualities of bond value, including advanced topics for adjusting value based on duration and convexity In the next chapter, you'll practice these skills in a final comprehensive case study.
