Now that you've calculated convexity for your bond, you can estimate the effect of convexity on the bond's price.

Specifically, recall from the video that the percentage change based on convexity is given by
0.5 x convexity x (change_y)^2

where change_y is the expected change in yield. 
The dollar change based on convexity is equal to the 
percentage change multiplied by the current price P.

For this exercise, assume that yields are expected to decline by 1%.

The convexity object, which you calculated in the previous exercise as 116.521, and the px object, which is the price of the bond of $100, have been preloaded in your workspace.




Estimate percentage change (convexity_pct_change) based on convexity if yields decrease by 1%.
Estimate dollar change (convexity_dollar_change) based on convexity if yields decrease by 1%.


>convexity
[1] 116.521
>px
[1] 100




# Estimate percentage change
change_yield <- 0.01
convexity_pct_change <- 0.5 * convexity * (change_yield)^2
convexity_pct_change
[1] 0.00582605


# Estimate dollar change
convexity_dollar_change <- convexity_pct_change * px
convexity_dollar_change
[1] 0.582605



While the dollar change due to convexity in this case is relatively small, it is important to control for in your overall estimation.
