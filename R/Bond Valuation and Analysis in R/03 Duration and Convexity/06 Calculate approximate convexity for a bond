Recall from the video that we can improve the estimate of the bond price by adding a convexity term to the duration effect. The convexity term accounts for how bowed the price/YTM curve is for the bond.

In this exercise, you will calculate the approximate convexity for a bond with $100 par value, 10% coupon, 20 years to maturity, and 10% yield to maturity when you expect a 1% change in yield and add that to the duration effect. Recall that the approximate convexity formula is
(P_up + P_down - 2*P) / (P x (change_y)^2)

where P is the price of the bond,
P_up is the price of the bond when yields increase,
P_down is the price of the bond when yields decrease, and
change_y is the expected change in yield.



The objects px, px_up, and px_down from the earlier exercise are preloaded in your workspace.
Calculate approximate convexity by incorporating the px, px_up, and px_down objects into the formula listed above. You will also need to input an appropriate value for dy.



>px
[1] 100
>px_up
[1] 92.03667
>px_down
[1] 109.1285


# 1 % POINT change in yield
# Calculate approximate convexity
convexity <- (px_up + px_down - 2 * px) / (px * (0.01)^2)
convexity
[1] 116.521

As you saw in the video, measuring convexity will dramatically improve your overall estimate of bond price. You'll practice this in the next exercise.
