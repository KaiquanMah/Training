In Chapter Three, you learned to use the approximate duration formula. As a refresher, the formula for approximate duration is:
(P_down - P_up) / (2 x P x change_y)

where P is the price of the bond today,
P_up is the price of the bond if yields increase,
P_down is the price of the bond if yields decrease, and 
change_y is the expected change in yield.

In this exercise, you will calculate duration. Specifically, you'll use the bondprc() function to calculate px_up and px_down.

The objects px and aaa_yield from the prior exercises are preloaded in your workspace. For this exercise, assume that the expected change in yield is an increase of 1%. As before, the coupon rate is 3% (0.03) and the time to maturity 8 years.




Use bondprc() to calculate the price of the bond when yields increase by 1%. Save this to px_up.
Use bondprc() to calculate the price of the bond when yields decrease by 1%. Save this to px_down.
Use px, px_up, and px_down to calculate duration with the formula above.
Calculate and view the percentage effect of duration on price (duration_pct_change) based on duration.
Calculate and view the dollar effect of duration on price (duration_dollar_change) based on duration.



# Calculate bond price when yield increases
# px [1] 97.17106
coupon <- 0.03
ttm <- 8
aaa_yield
[1] 0.0341

# exercise ALSO ASSUMES INITIAL PRICE P = 100, NOT px!
px_up <- bondprc(p = 100, 
                 r = coupon, 
                 ttm = ttm, 
                 y = aaa_yield+0.01)
                 
                 
# Calculate bond price when yield decreases
px_down <- bondprc(p = 100, 
                   r = coupon, 
                   ttm = ttm, 
                   y = aaa_yield-0.01)




# Calculate duration
# 1% point change in yield => 0.01
duration <- (px_down - px_up) / (2 * px * 0.01)



# Calculate percentage effect of duration on price
# 1% point change in yield => 0.01
# remember to add '-' minus sign before duration!!!
duration_pct_change <- - duration * 0.01
duration_pct_change
[1] -0.06988271



# Calculate dollar effect of duration on price
duration_dollar_change <- px * duration_pct_change
duration_dollar_change
[1] -6.790577




You derived several important values, including duration itself, the percentage effect of duration on price and the dollar effect of duration on price, based on relatively few inputs.
