In the above example, you may have coded the cash flow vector by writing cf <- c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 103).

However, this may seem a bit tedious. An alternative is to code the cash flow vector using the rep() command. Typing rep(x, y) will automatically repeat x y times. For example, rep(1, 4) is equivalent to typing c(1, 1, 1, 1).

In this exercise, you'll construct a more general function for computing a cash flow vector based on a series of inputs: r for coupon rate, p for par value, and ttm for time to maturity. To do so, you'll take advantage of the rep() command.



Code an alternative cash flow function using rep() and input variables r, p, and ttm. Save this new function as alt_cf.
Use alt_cf to generate a cash flow vector with coupon rate (r) of 3% (0.03), par value (p) of $100, and time to maturity (ttm) of 8 years.


# Code cash flow function
alt_cf <- function(r, p, ttm) {
  c(rep(p * r, ttm - 1), p * (1 + r))
}



# Generate cf vector
alt_cf(r = 0.03, p = 100, ttm = 8)
[1]   3   3   3   3   3   3   3 103


As you can see, the cash flow vector produced by your alt_cf() function is identical to the one you manually encoded in the previous exercise.
