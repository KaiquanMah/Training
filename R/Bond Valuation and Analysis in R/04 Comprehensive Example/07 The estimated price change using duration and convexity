In the prior exercises, you estimated that if yields increase by 1%, you can expect a dollar effect due to duration of -6.773486 and dollar effect due to convexity of 0.28423. These two values are stored in the objects duration_dollar_change and convexity_dollar_change, respectively. You also know that the bond has a current price of $96.96787, which is stored in the workspace as the object px.
Recall from Chapter Three that accurate price estimations should take into account both duration and convexity. In this exercise, you will be asked to calculate the estimated change in the price based on duration and convexity. You'll then calculate the new estimated price assuming a 1% increase in yields.


Estimate total change in price given a 1% increase in yields based on duration_dollar_change and convexity_dollar_change. Save this value to price_change.
Use price_change to calculate the new_price of your bond!

# Estimate price_change
price_change <- duration_dollar_change + convexity_dollar_change
price_change
[1] -6.505532


# Estimate new_price
px
[1] 97.17106

new_price <- px + duration_dollar_change + convexity_dollar_change
new_price
[1] 90.66553


You now have a clear and reliable estimate of bond price based on duration adjusted for convexity!
