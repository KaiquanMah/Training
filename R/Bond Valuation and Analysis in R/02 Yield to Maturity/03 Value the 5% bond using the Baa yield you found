From the prior exercise, you found that the yield on comparable bonds is 4.29%.

Now that you know the yield, you can use this information to find the value of a Baa-rated bond on September 30, 2016 with a $100 par value, 5% coupon rate, and 5 years to maturity.

In this exercise, you will use the bondprc function you created in Chapter 1 to value the bond. The object you created in the previous exercise (baa_yield) is available in your workspace.



Use bondprc() to value your bond. Recall from Chapter One that the bondprc() function you created takes four arguments: the par value (p), the coupon rate (r), the time to maturity (ttm), and the yield of the bond (y).

# Value bond
# yield on comparable bonds is 4.29%
bondprc(p = 100, 
        r = 0.05, 
        ttm = 5, 
        y = 0.0429)
[1] 103.1352

Your calculations suggest that the bond is valued at approximately $103 despite its par value being only $100.
