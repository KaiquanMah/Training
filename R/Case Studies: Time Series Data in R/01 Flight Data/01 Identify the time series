Welcome to this practice course on manipulating time series data using xts & zoo! This course is designed to review the time series tools available in R. As with most components of data analysis, much of the work of time series analysis involves data cleaning and manipulation. This course builds directly on the key concepts covered in DataCamp's introductory course on xts & zoo.

Before moving forward, lets go over some of the fundamentals of time series data.

Which of the following sets of information would be appropriate for time series data manipulation?


Possible Answers

The GDP of OECD countries last year.
Not quite! Although GDP last year has a specific time value, you can only use time series tools when you have data from multiple time periods.


YES     Annual snowfall in Chicago between 1950 and 2000.
Exactly! Data on annual snowfall for Chicago would contain entries across multiple time periods (for example, 1950, 1951, 1952â€¦). The goal of time series analysis is often to explore how these values change over time.
