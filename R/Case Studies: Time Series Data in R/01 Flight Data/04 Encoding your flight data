You're ready to encode your data to an xts object! Remember that flights is a data frame containing four columns of flight data and one column of dates.

To convert to an xts object, you'll need to ensure that your date column is in a time-based format. As you discovered earlier, the date column is currently a character. Once date is saved in a time-based format, you're ready to convert to xts! To do so, you'll use as.xts(), which takes two primary arguments.
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/xts/versions/0.9-7/topics/as.xts.methods
First, you'll need to specify the object being converted (in this case, flights). To avoid redundancies, you should generally remove the time-based column from the data when you convert to xts. In this case, you'll remove the fifth column (dates), by specifying [, -5] in your as.xts() call.

Second, you'll need to tell xts how to index your object by specifying the order.by argument. In this case, you want to index your object on the date column.

The flights data frame is preloaded for you.

# Load the xts package
library(xts)


# Convert date column to a time-based class
flights$date <- as.Date(flights$date)


# Convert flights to an xts object using as.xts
# not removing the 'date' col => your xts object will have weird ways to store values later + there will be 2 date cols
# flights_xts <- as.xts(flights, order.by = flights$date)
>as.xts(flights, order.by = flights$date)

Your new xts object contains four columns of information about flights indexed on a series of months and years.
