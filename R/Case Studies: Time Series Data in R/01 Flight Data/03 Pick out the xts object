It looks like your flights data will need some modifications before it can be turned into an xts object. As you know, there are many different types of objects in R. xts objects are specifically designed for time series functionality.

Which of the following accurately describes the internal structure of an xts object?

Possible Answers

A simple matrix.


A data frame in which one column is a time-based object.
Not exactly. You can conduct time series analysis with data frames containing a time column, but these objects are not as versatile as xts objects because they do not rely on a universal time-based index.


A vector of time information.


A matrix indexed on a time-based object.
Exactly! xts objects have the functionality of a simple matrix while containing an index allowing easy manipulation over time.
