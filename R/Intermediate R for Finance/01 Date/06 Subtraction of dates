Just like with numerics, arithmetic can be done on dates. In particular, you can find the difference between two dates, in days, by using subtraction:

today <- as.Date("2017-01-02")
tomorrow <- as.Date("2017-01-03")
one_year_away <- as.Date("2018-01-02")

tomorrow - today
Time difference of 1 days

one_year_away - today
Time difference of 365 days
Equivalently, you could use the difftime() function to find the time interval instead.

difftime(tomorrow, today)
Time difference of 1 days

# With some extra options!
difftime(tomorrow, today, units = "secs")
Time difference of 86400 secs




A vector of dates has been created for you.
You can use subtraction to confirm that January 1, 1970 is the first date that R counts from. First, create a variable called origin containing "1970-01-01" as a date.
Now, use as.numeric() on dates to see how many days from January 1, 1970 it has been.
Finally, subtract origin from dates to confirm the results! (Notice how recycling is used here!)


# Dates
dates <- as.Date(c("2017-01-01", "2017-01-02", "2017-01-03"))

# Create the origin
origin <- as.Date("1970-01-01")
as.numeric(origin)
[1] 0


# Use as.numeric() on dates
as.numeric(dates)
[1] 17167 17168 17169

# Find the difference between dates and origin
dates - origin
Time differences in days
[1] 17167 17168 17169




Check your call of as.numeric(). Did you correctly specify the argument x?
NOT SURE WHAT IS THE PROBLEM DURING SUBMISSION
AS.NUMERIC IS WORKING PROPERLY ABOVE




>difftime(dates[3], dates[1])
Time difference of 2 days

>difftime(dates[3], dates[1], units = "hrs")
Error: 'arg' should be one of “auto”, “secs”, “mins”, “hours”, “days”, “weeks”

>difftime(dates[3], dates[1], units = "hours")
Time difference of 48 hours
