Sometimes it makes sense to have nested if statements to add even more control. In the following exercise, you will add an if statement that checks if you are holding a share of the Microsoft stock before you attempt to sell it.

Here is the structure of nested if statements, it should look somewhat familiar:

if(condition1) {        
    if(condition2) {     
        code if both pass
    } else {            
        code if 1 passes, 2 fails
    }
} else {            
    code if 1 fails
}



The variables micr and shares have been created for you.
Fill in the nested if statement to check if shares is greater than or equal to 1 before you decide to sell.
If this is true, then print "Sell!".
Else, print "Not enough shares to sell!"


# micr
micr <- 105.67
shares <- 1

# Fill in the blanks
if( micr < 55 ) {
    print("Buy!")
} else if( micr >= 55 & micr < 75 ) {
    print("Do nothing!")
} else { 
    if( shares >= 1 ) {
        print("Sell!")
    } else {
        print("Not enough shares to sell!")
    }
}

[1] "Sell!"
