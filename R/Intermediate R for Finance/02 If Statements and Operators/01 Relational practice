In the video, Lore taught you all about different types of relational operators. For reference, here they are again:

> : Greater than
>=: Greater than or equal to
< : Less than
<=: Less than or equal to
==: Equality
!=: Not equal
These relational operators let us make comparisons in our data. If the equation is true, then the relational operator will return TRUE, otherwise it will return FALSE.

apple <- 45.46
microsoft <- 67.88

apple <= microsoft
[1] TRUE
hello <- "Hello world"

# Case sensitive!
hello == "hello world"
[1] FALSE




micr and apple stock prices have been created for you.
Is apple larger than micr? Use >.
The != operator returns TRUE if two objects are not equal. Use != with apple and micr.

Two dates have been created for you.
Is tomorrow less than today?






# Stock prices
apple <- 48.99
micr <- 77.93

# Apple vs Microsoft
apple > micr
[1] FALSE

# Not equals
apple != micr
[1] TRUE



# Dates - today and tomorrow
today <- as.Date(Sys.Date())
tomorrow <- as.Date(Sys.Date() + 1)

# Today vs Tomorrow
tomorrow < today
[1] FALSE
