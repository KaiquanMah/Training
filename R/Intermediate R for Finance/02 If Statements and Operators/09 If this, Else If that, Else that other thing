To add even more logic, you can follow the pattern of if, else if, else. You can add as many else if's as you need for your control logic.

if(condition1) {
    code if condition1 is true
} else if(condition2) {
    code if condition2 is true
} else {
    code if both are false
}


Extend the last example by filling in the blanks to complete the following logic:
if micr is less than 55, print "Buy!"
else if greater than or equal to 55 and micr is less than 75, print "Do nothing!"
else print "Sell!"


# micr
micr <- 105.67

# Fill in the blanks
if( micr < 55 ) {
    print("Buy!")
} else if( micr >= 55 & micr < 75 ){
    print("Do nothing!")
} else { 
    print("Sell!")
}

[1] "Sell!"
