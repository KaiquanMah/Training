While loops are slightly different from repeat loops. Like if statements, you specify the condition for them to run at the very beginning. There is no need for a break statement because the condition is checked at each iteration.

while (condition) {
    code
}
It might seem like the while loop is doing the exact same thing as the repeat loop, just with less code. In our cases, this is true. So, why ever use the repeat loop? Occasionally, there are cases when using a repeat loop to run forever is desired. If you are interested, click here and check out Intentional Looping.

For the exercise, imagine that you have a debt of $5000 that you need to pay back. Each month, you pay off $500 dollars, until you've paid everything off. You will use a loop to model the process of paying off the debt each month, where each iteration you decrease your total debt and print out the new total!




The variable debt has been created for you.
Fill in the while loop condition to check if debt is greater than 0. If this is true, decrease debt by 500.


# Initial debt
debt <- 5000

# While loop to pay off your debt
while (debt > 0) {
  debt <- debt - 500
  print(paste("Debt remaining", debt))
}
[1] "Debt remaining 4500"
[1] "Debt remaining 4000"
[1] "Debt remaining 3500"
[1] "Debt remaining 3000"
[1] "Debt remaining 2500"
[1] "Debt remaining 2000"
[1] "Debt remaining 1500"
[1] "Debt remaining 1000"
[1] "Debt remaining 500"
[1] "Debt remaining 0"
