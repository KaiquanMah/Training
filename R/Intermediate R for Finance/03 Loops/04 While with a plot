Loops can be used for all kinds of fun examples! What if you wanted to visualize your debt decreasing over time? Like the last exercise, this one uses a loop to model paying it off, $500 at a time. However, at each iteration you will also append your remaining debt total to a plot, so that you can visualize the total decreasing as you go.

This exercise has already been done for you. Let's talk about what is happening here.

First, initialize some variables:
debt = Your current debt
i = Incremented each time debt is reduced. The next point on the x axis.
x_axis = A vector of i's. The x axis for the plots.
y_axis = A vector of debt. The y axis for the plots.
Also, create the first plot. Just a single point of your current debt.

Then, create a while loop. As long as you still have debt:
debt is reduced by 500.
i is incremented.
x_axis is extended by 1 more point.
y_axis is extended by the next debt point.
The next plot is created from the updated data.

After you run the code, you can use Previous Plot to go back and view all 11 of the created plots!

debt <- 5000    # initial debt
i <- 0          # x axis counter
x_axis <- i     # x axis
y_axis <- debt  # y axis

# Initial plot
plot(x_axis, y_axis, xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,5000))

# Graph your debt
while (debt > 0) {

  # Updating variables
  debt <- debt - 500
  i <- i + 1
  x_axis <- c(x_axis, i)
  y_axis <- c(y_axis, debt)
  
  # Next plot
  plot(x_axis, y_axis, xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,5000))
}


# during each iteration of while loop
# debt reduce by 500
# iteration counter increment by 1

# during 1st iteration
# i increments to 1
# x_axis contained 0 => then c(x_axis, i) makes it c(0, 1)
# y_axis contained 5000 from reference to debt => then c(y_axis, debt) makes it c(5000, 4500)
# then plot the point/coordinate on the chart

...then iterate through the while loop...
...x_axis, y_axis vectors grow after appending more elements...
>x_axis
 [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
>y_axis
 [1] 5000 4500 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000  500    0

...so the subsequent plots show more points...
