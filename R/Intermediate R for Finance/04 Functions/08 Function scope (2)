Let's try another one. Here, hundred is defined outside of the function scope, but is used inside of the function.

hundred <- 100

percent_to_decimal <- function(percent) {
    percent / hundred
}



What will percent_to_decimal(6) return?
0.06


Good job! hundred was defined outside of the percent_to_decimal() function. When the percent_to_decimal function came across hundred, it first looked inside the scope of the function for hundred, and when it couldn't find it, it looked up one level to find where it was defined in the global scope.
