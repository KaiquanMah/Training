Scoping is the process of how R looks a variable's value when given a name. For example, given x <- 5, scoping is how R knows where to look to find that the value of x is 5.

Try this scoping exercise!

percent_to_decimal <- function(percent) {
    decimal <- percent / 100
    decimal
}

percent_to_decimal(6)
[1] 0.06


What does typing decimal now return?
Error



Great! decimal was defined to live only inside the percent_to_decimal() function. If you try to access decimal outside of the scope of that function, you will get an error because it does not exist!
