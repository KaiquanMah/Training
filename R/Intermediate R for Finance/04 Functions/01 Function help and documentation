When you don't know how to use a function, or don't know what arguments it takes, where do you turn? Luckily for you, R has built in documentation. For example, to get help for the names() function, you can type one of:

?names

?names()

help(names)
These all do the same thing; they take you straight to the help page for names()!

In the DataCamp console, this takes you to the RDocumentation site to get help from there, but the information is all the same!

Below, you will explore the documentation for a few other functions.



Use ? to look at the documentation for subset().
Use ? to look at the documentation for Sys.time().


# subset help
?subset

# Sys.time help
?Sys.time
