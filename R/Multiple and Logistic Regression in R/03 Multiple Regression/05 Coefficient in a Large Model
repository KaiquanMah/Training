Interpretation of coefficient in a big model
This time we have thrown even more variables into our model, including the number of bids in each auction (nBids) and the number of wheels. Unfortunately this makes a full visualization of our model impossible, but we can still interpret the coefficients.

Call:
lm(formula = totalPr ~ duration + startPr + cond + wheels + nBids, 
    data = mario_kart)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)     duration      startPr     condused       wheels  
    39.3741      -0.2752       0.1796      -4.7720       6.7216  
      nBids  
     0.1909  

Choose the correct interpretation of the coefficient on the number of wheels:

The average number of wheels is 6.72.
Each additional wheel costs exactly $6.72.
Each additional wheel is associated with an increase in the expected auction price of $6.72.

#yes Each additional wheel is associated with an increase in the expected auction price of $6.72, after controlling for auction duration, starting price, number of bids, and the condition of the item.
