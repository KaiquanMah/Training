Coefficient magnitude
The coefficients from our model for the total auction price of MarioKarts as a function of auction duration and starting price are shown below.

Call:
lm(formula = totalPr ~ duration + startPr, data = mario_kart)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)     duration      startPr  
     51.030       -1.508        0.233  

A colleague claims that these results imply that the duration of the auction is a more important determinant of final price than starting price, because the coefficient is larger. This interpretation is false because:

The coefficient on duration is negative.
Smaller coefficients are more important.
The intercept coefficient is much bigger, so it is the most important one.

#yes The coefficients have different units (dollars per day and dollars per dollar, respectively) and so they are not directly comparable.








Practicing interpretation
Fit a multiple regression model for the total auction price of an item in the mario_kart data set as a function of the starting price and the duration of the auction. Compute the coefficients and choose the correct interpretation of the duration variable.

#yes For each additional day the auction lasts, the expected final price declines by $1.51, after controlling for starting price.

For each additional dollar of starting price, the expected final price increases by $0.23, after controlling for the duration of the auction.
The duration of the auction is a more important determinant of final price than starting price, because the coefficient is larger.
The average auction lasts 51 days.
