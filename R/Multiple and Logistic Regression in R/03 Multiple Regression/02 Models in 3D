Models in 3D
An alternative way to visualize a multiple regression model with two numeric explanatory variables is as a plane in three dimensions. This is possible in R using the plotly package.

We have created three objects that you will need:
x: a vector of unique values of duration
y: a vector of unique values of startPr
plane: a matrix of the fitted values across all combinations of x and y

Much like ggplot(), the plot_ly() function will allow you to create a plot object with variables mapped to x, y, and z aesthetics. The add_markers() function is similar to geom_point() in that it allows you to add points to your 3D plot.
Note that plot_ly uses the pipe (%>%) operator to chain commands together.


Run the plot_ly command to draw 3D scatterplot for totalPr as a function of duration and startPr by mapping the z variable to the response and the x and y variables to the explanatory variables. Duration should be on the x-axis and starting price should be on the y-axis.
Use add_surface() to draw a plane through the cloud of points by setting z = ~plane.

# draw the 3D scatterplot
p <- plot_ly(data = mario_kart, z = ~totalPr, x = ~duration, y = ~startPr, opacity = 0.6) %>%
  add_markers() 
  
# draw the plane
p %>%
  add_surface(x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~plane, showscale = FALSE)
