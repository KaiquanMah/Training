Exploratory data analysis
Multiple regression can be an effective technique for understanding how a response variable changes as a result of changes to more than one explanatory variable. But it is not magic -- understanding the relationships among the explanatory variables is also necessary, and will help us build a better model. This process is often called exploratory data analysis (EDA) and is covered in another DataCamp course.
One quick technique for jump-starting EDA is to examine all of the pairwise scatterplots in your data. This can be achieved using the pairs() function. Look for variables in the nyc data set that are strongly correlated, as those relationships will help us check for multicollinearity later on.

Which pairs of variables appear to be strongly correlated?

SLR models
Based on your knowledge of the restaurant industry, do you think that the quality of the food in a restaurant is an important determinant of the price of a meal at that restaurant? It would be hard to imagine that it wasn't. We'll start our modeling process by plotting and fitting a model for Price as a function of Food.
On your own, interpret these coefficients and examine the fit of the model. What does the coefficient of Food mean in plain English? "Each additional rating point of food quality is associated with a..."

Use ggplot to make a scatter plot for Price as a function of Food.
Use lm() to fit a simple linear regression model for Price as a function of Food.


# Price by Food plot
ggplot(data=nyc, aes(x=Food, y=Price)) +
  geom_point()

# Price by Food model
lm(Price ~ Food, data=nyc)
Call:
lm(formula = Price ~ Food, data = nyc)
