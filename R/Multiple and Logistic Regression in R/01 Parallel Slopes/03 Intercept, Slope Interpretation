Intercept interpretation
Recall that the cond variable is either new or used. Here are the fitted coefficients from your model:

Call:
lm(formula = totalPr ~ wheels + cond, data = mario_kart)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)       wheels     condused  
     42.370        7.233       -5.585  

Choose the correct interpretation of the coefficient on condused:
#The expected price of a used MarioKart is $5.58 less than that of a new one with the same number of wheels.








Common slope interpretation
Recall the fitted coefficients from our model:

Call:
lm(formula = totalPr ~ wheels + cond, data = mario_kart)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)       wheels     condused  
     42.370        7.233       -5.585  

Choose the correct interpretation of the slope coefficient:
#For each additional wheel, the expected price of a MarioKart increases by $7.23 regardless of whether it is new or used.
