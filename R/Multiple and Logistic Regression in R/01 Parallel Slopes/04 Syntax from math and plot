Syntax from math
The babies data set contains observations about the birthweight and other characteristics of children born in the San Francisco Bay area from 1960--1967.
We would like to build a model for birthweight as a function of the mother's age and whether this child was her first (parity == 0). Use the mathematical specification below to code the model in R.
birthweight = β0 + β1⋅age + β2⋅parity + ϵ

The birthweight variable is recorded in the column bwt.
Use lm() to build the parallel slopes model specified above. It's not necessary to use factor() in this case as the variable parity is coded using binary numeric values.

# build model
lm(bwt ~ age + parity, data=babies)
Call:
lm(formula = bwt ~ age + parity, data = babies)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)          age       parity

Syntax from plot
This time, we'd like to build a model for birthweight as a function of the length of gestation and the mother's smoking status. Use the plot to inform your model specification.
Use lm() to build a parallel slopes model implied by the plot. It's not necessary to use factor() in this case either.

# build model
lm(bwt ~ gestation + factor(smoke), data=babies)
> lm(bwt ~ gestation + factor(smoke), data=babies)

Call:
lm(formula = bwt ~ gestation + factor(smoke), data = babies)

Coefficients:
   (Intercept)       gestation  factor(smoke)1  
       -0.9317          0.4429         -8.0883
       


> lm(bwt ~ gestation + smoke, data=babies)

Call:
lm(formula = bwt ~ gestation + smoke, data = babies)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    gestation        smoke  
    -0.9317       0.4429      -8.0883
