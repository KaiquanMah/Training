Bing tidy polarity: Call me Ishmael (with ggplot2)!
The last Bing lexicon exercise! In this exercise you will use the pipe operator (%>%) to create a timeline of the sentiment in Moby Dick. In the end you will also create a simple visual following the code structure below. The next chapter goes into more depth for visuals.

ggplot(spread_data, aes(index_column, polarity_column)) +
  geom_smooth()


Inner join moby to the bing lexicon.
Call inner_join() to join the tibbles.
Join by the term column in the text and the word column in the lexicon.

Count by sentiment and index.

Reshape so that each sentiment has its own column.
Call spread().
The key column (to split into multiple columns) is sentiment.
The value column (containing the counts) is n.
Also specify fill = 0 to fill out missing values with a zero.

Use mutate() to add the polarity column. Define it as the difference between the positive and negative columns.


moby_polarity <- moby %>%
  # Inner join to lexicon
  inner_join(bing, by = c("term" = "word")) %>%
  # Count the sentiment scores
  count(sentiment, index) %>% 
  # Spread the sentiment into positive and negative columns
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  # Add polarity column
  mutate(polarity = positive-negative)
  
  
  
> moby_polarity
# A tibble: 9,234 x 4
   index negative positive polarity
   <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
 1     5        0        1        1
 2     9        1        0       -1
 3    11        1        0       -1
 4    13        0        1        1
 5    17        0        1        1
 6    19        0        1        1
 7    22        1        0       -1
 8    24        0        1        1
 9    25        0        1        1
10    31        0        2        2
# ... with 9,224 more rows  




Using moby_polarity, plot polarity vs. index.
Add a smooth trend layer by calling geom_smooth() with no arguments.  
# Plot polarity vs. index
ggplot(moby_polarity, aes(x=index, y=polarity)) + 
  # Add a smooth trend curve
  geom_smooth()   
  
  
  
Does Moby Dick have a happy ending?
