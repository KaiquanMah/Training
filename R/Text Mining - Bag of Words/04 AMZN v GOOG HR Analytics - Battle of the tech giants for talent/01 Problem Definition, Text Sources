Organizing a text mining project
How many well-defined steps are in the text mining process?

#6
There are 6 well-defined steps in the text mining process. This chapter will review those steps as a case study.





Step 1: Problem definition
Which of these is NOT an appropriate problem statement?

#appropriate Does Amazon or Google have a better perceived pay according to online reviews?

#not appropriate Let's learn something about how employees review both Amazon and Google.
This one is too general.

#appropriate Does Amazon or Google have a better work-life balance according to current employees?








Step 2: Identifying the text sources
Employee reviews can come from various sources. If your human resources department had the resources, you could have a third party administer focus groups to interview employees both internally and from your competitor.
Forbes and others publish articles about the "best places to work", which may mention Amazon and Google. Another source of information might be anonymous online reviews from websites like Indeed, Glassdoor or CareerBliss.
Here, we'll focus on a collection of anonymous online reviews.
