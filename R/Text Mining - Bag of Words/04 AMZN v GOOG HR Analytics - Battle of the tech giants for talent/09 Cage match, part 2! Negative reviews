Cage match, part 2! Negative reviews
In both organizations, people mentioned "culture" and "smart people", so there are some similar positive aspects between the two companies. However with the pyramid plot you can start to infer degrees of positive features of the work environments.
You now decide to turn your attention to negative reviews and make the same visual. This time you already have the common_words data frame in your workspace. However, the common bigrams in this exercise come from negative employee reviews.


Using top_n() on common_words, obtain the top 5 bigrams weighted on the diff column. The results of the new object will print to your console.
Create a pyramid.plot(). Pass in top5_df$AmazonNeg, top5_df$GoogleNeg, and labels = top5_df$terms. For better labeling, set
gap to 12.
top.labels to c("Amzn", "Neg Words", "Goog")
The main and unit arguments are set for you.




> head(top5_df)
  AmazonNeg GoogleNeg            terms diff
1         3        12        can think    9
2        20         8     life balance   12
3        29        10       long hours   19
4        21         8        work life   13
5        21         8 worklife balance   13



# Extract top 5 common bigrams
(top5_df <- top_n(common_words, n=5, diff))

# Create a pyramid plot
pyramid.plot(
    # Amazon on the left
    top5_df$AmazonNeg,
    # Google on the right
    top5_df$GoogleNeg,
    # Use terms for labels
    labels = top5_df$terms,
    # Set the gap to 12
    gap = 12,
    # Set top.labels to "Amzn", "Neg Words" & "Goog"
    top.labels = c("Amzn", "Neg Words", "Goog"),
    main = "Words in Common", 
    unit = NULL
)
