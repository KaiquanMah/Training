Quick review of Google reviews
You decide to create a comparison.cloud() of Google's positive and negative reviews for comparison to Amazon. This will give you a quick understanding of top terms without having to spend as much time as you did examining the Amazon reviews in the previous exercises.
We've provided you with a corpus all_goog_corpus, which has the 500 positive and 500 negative reviews for Google. Here, you'll clean the corpus and create a comparison cloud comparing the common words in both pro and con reviews.


The all_goog_corpus object consisting of Google pro and con reviews is loaded in your workspace.
Create all_goog_corp by cleaning all_goog_corpus with the predefined tm_clean() function.
Create all_tdm by converting all_goog_corp to a term-document matrix.
Create all_m by converting all_tdm to a matrix.
Construct a comparison.cloud() from all_m. Set max.words to 100. The colors argument is specified for you.

# Create all_tdm

all_tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(all_goog_corp)

# Create all_m
all_m <- as.matrix(all_tdm)

# Build a comparison cloud
comparison.cloud(all_m, 
    max.words = 100, 
    colors = c("#F44336", "#2196f3"))
