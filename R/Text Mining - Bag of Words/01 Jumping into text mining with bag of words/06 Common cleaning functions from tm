Common cleaning functions from tm
Now that you know two ways to make a corpus, you can focus on cleaning, or preprocessing, the text. First, you'll clean a small piece of text, then you will move on to larger corpora.

In bag of words text mining, cleaning helps aggregate terms. For example, it might make sense for the words "miner", "mining" and "mine" to be considered one term. Specific preprocessing steps will vary based on the project. For example, the words used in tweets are vastly different than those used in legal documents, so the cleaning process can also be quite different.

Common preprocessing functions include:
tolower(): Make all characters lowercase
removePunctuation(): Remove all punctuation marks
removeNumbers(): Remove numbers
stripWhitespace(): Remove excess whitespace
tolower() is part of base R, while the other three functions come from the tm package. Going forward, we'll load tm and qdap for you when they are needed. Every time we introduce a new package, we'll have you load it the first time.

The variable text, containing a sentence, is shown in the script.




Apply each of the following functions to text, simply printing results to the console:
- `tolower()`
- `removePunctuation()`
- `removeNumbers()`
- `stripWhitespace()`


# Create the object: text
text <- "<b>She</b> woke up at       6 A.M. It\'s so early!  She was only 10% awake and began drinking coffee in front of her computer."


# Make lowercase
tolower(text)


# Remove punctuation
removePunctuation(text)


# Remove numbers
removeNumbers(text)


# Remove whitespace
stripWhitespace(text)






> text
[1] "<b>She</b> woke up at       6 A.M. It's so early!  She was only 10% awake and began drinking coffee in front of her computer."

> tolower(text)
[1] "<b>she</b> woke up at       6 a.m. it's so early!  she was only 10% awake and began drinking coffee in front of her computer."

> removePunctuation(text)
[1] "bSheb woke up at       6 AM Its so early  She was only 10 awake and began drinking coffee in front of her computer"

> removeNumbers(text)
[1] "<b>She</b> woke up at        A.M. It's so early!  She was only % awake and began drinking coffee in front of her computer."

> stripWhitespace(text)
[1] "<b>She</b> woke up at 6 A.M. It's so early! She was only 10% awake and began drinking coffee in front of her computer."


Do you see how powerful this could be if all of the tm functions are applied to the same document?
