Make a term-document matrix
You're almost done with the not-so-exciting foundational work before we get to some fun visualizations and analyses based on the concepts you've learned so far!
In this exercise, you are performing a similar process but taking the transpose of the document-term matrix. In this case, the term-document matrix has terms in the first column and documents across the top as individual column names.
The TDM is often the matrix used for language analysis. This is because you likely have more terms than authors or documents and life is generally easier when you have more rows than columns. An easy way to start analyzing the information is to change the matrix into a simple matrix using as.matrix() on the TDM.


Create coffee_tdm by applying TermDocumentMatrix() to clean_corp.
Create coffee_m by converting coffee_tdm to a matrix using as.matrix().
Print the dimensions of coffee_m to the console. Note the number of rows and columns.
Print the subset of coffee_m containing terms (rows) "star" and "starbucks" and documents (columns) 25 through 35.


# Create a term-document matrix from the corpus
coffee_tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(clean_corp)

# Print coffee_tdm data
coffee_tdm
> coffee_tdm
<<TermDocumentMatrix (terms: 3101, documents: 1000)>>
Non-/sparse entries: 7724/3093276
Sparsity           : 100%
Maximal term length: 33
Weighting          : term frequency (tf)



# Convert coffee_tdm to a matrix
coffee_m <- as.matrix(coffee_tdm)

# Print the dimensions of the matrix
dim(coffee_m)
> dim(coffee_m)
[1] 3101 1000

# Review a portion of the matrix
coffee_m[c("star", "starbucks"), 25:35]
> coffee_m[c("star", "starbucks"), 25:35]
           Docs
Terms       25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35
  star       0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  starbucks  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0








Understanding TDM and DTM
When should you use the term-document matrix instead of the document-term matrix?

#yes When you want the words as rows and documents as columns.
TDM's have row/terms and DTM's have row/documents. The first letter specifies the row structure.
