Cleaning with qdap
The qdap package offers other text cleaning functions. Each is useful in its own way and is particularly powerful when combined with the others.

bracketX(): Remove all text within brackets (e.g. "It's (so) cool" becomes "It's cool")
replace_number(): Replace numbers with their word equivalents (e.g. "2" becomes "two")
replace_abbreviation(): Replace abbreviations with their full text equivalents (e.g. "Sr" becomes "Senior")
replace_contraction(): Convert contractions back to their base words (e.g. "shouldn't" becomes "should not")
replace_symbol() Replace common symbols with their word equivalents (e.g. "$" becomes "dollar")


Apply the following functions to the text object from the previous exercise:
bracketX()
replace_number()
replace_abbreviation()
replace_contraction()
replace_symbol()
