Teaser: simple word clustering
In the next chapter, we cover some miscellaneous (yet very important) text mining subjects including:

TDM/DTM weighting
Dealing with TDM/DTM sparsity
Capturing metadata
Simple word clustering for topics
Analysis on more than one word

For now, let's simply create a new visual called a dendrogram from our coffee_tweets. The next chapter will explain it in detail.




A hierarchical cluster object, hc, has been created for you from the coffee tweets.
Create a dendrogram using plot() on hc.

> hc
Call:
hclust(d = dist(coffee_tdm2, method = "euclidean"), method = "complete")

Cluster method   : complete 
Distance         : euclidean 
Number of objects: 46

# Plot a dendrogram
plot(hc)
