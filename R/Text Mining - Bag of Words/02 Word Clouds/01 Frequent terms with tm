Test your understanding of text mining
What is the best business reason to create a text mining visual like a word cloud?
#Words clouds help decision makers come to quick conclusions.



Frequent terms with tm
Now that you know how to make a term-document matrix, as well as its transpose, the document-term matrix, we will use it as the basis for some analysis. In order to analyze it we need to change it to a simple matrix like we did in chapter 1 using as.matrix().
Calling rowSums() on your newly made matrix aggregates all the terms used in a passage. Once you have the rowSums(), you can sort() them with decreasing = TRUE, so you can focus on the most common terms.

Lastly, you can make a barplot() of the top 5 terms of term_frequency with the following code.
barplot(term_frequency[1:5], col = "#C0DE25")
Of course, you could take our ggplot2 course to learn how to customize the plot even more... :)


Create coffee_m as a matrix using the term-document matrix coffee_tdm from the last chapter.
Create term_frequency using the rowSums() function on coffee_m.
Sort term_frequency in descending order and store the result in term_frequency.
Use single square bracket subsetting, i.e. using only one [, to print the top 10 terms from term_frequency.
Make a barplot of the top 10 terms.

> term_frequency[1:10]
    like      cup      one     shop     just      get  morning     want 
     111      103       79       69       66       62       57       49 
drinking      can 
      47       45
      







## coffee_tdm is still loaded in your workspace

# Convert coffee_tdm to a matrix
coffee_m <- as.matrix(coffee_tdm)

# Calculate the row sums of coffee_m
term_frequency <- rowSums(coffee_m)

# Sort term_frequency in decreasing order
term_frequency <- sort(term_frequency, decreasing=TRUE)

# View the top 10 most common words
term_frequency[1:10]

# Plot a barchart of the 10 most common words
barplot(term_frequency[1:10], col = "tan", las = 2)


Frequent terms alone can sometimes yield quick insights about your text.
