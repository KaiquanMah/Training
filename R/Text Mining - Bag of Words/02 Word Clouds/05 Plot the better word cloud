Plot the better word cloud
Now that you've removed additional stopwords, let's take a look at the improved word cloud!
The term-document matrix from the previous exercise has been turned into matrix with as.matrix(), then a named vector was created with rowSums(). This new object of term frequencies called chardonnay_words is preloaded into your workspace. Let's take a look at these new wordcloud results.


We've loaded the wordcloud package for you behind the scenes and will do so for all additional exercises requiring it.
Sort the values in chardonnay_words with decreasing = TRUE. Save as sorted_chardonnay_words.
Look at the top 6 words in sorted_chardonnay_words and their values.
Create terms_vec using names() on chardonnay_words.
Pass terms_vec and chardonnay_words into the wordcloud() function. Review what other words pop out now that "chardonnay" is removed.

   

# Sort the chardonnay_words in descending order
sorted_chardonnay_words <- sort(chardonnay_words, decreasing = TRUE)

# Print the 6 most frequent chardonnay terms
head(sorted_chardonnay_words)
> head(sorted_chardonnay_words)
marvin   gaye   just   like bottle    lol 
   104     76     75     55     47     43
   
   
   
# Get a terms vector
terms_vec <- names(chardonnay_words)

# Create a wordcloud for the values in word_freqs
wordcloud(terms_vec, chardonnay_words, 
          max.words = 50, colors = "red")
          
          


See how removing words is a judgment call but can be helpful?
