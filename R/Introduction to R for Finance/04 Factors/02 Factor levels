Accessing the unique levels of your factor is simple enough by using the levels() function. You can also use this to rename your factor levels!

credit_factor
[1] AAA AA  A   BBB AA  BBB A  
Levels: A AA AAA BBB

levels(credit_factor)
[1] "A"   "AA"  "AAA" "BBB"

levels(credit_factor) <- c("1A", "2A", "3A", "3B")

credit_factor
[1] 3A 2A 1A 3B 2A 3B 1A
Levels: 1A 2A 3A 3B

The credit_factor variable you created in the last exercise is available in your workspace.



Use levels() on credit_factor to identify the unique levels.
Using the same "1A", "2A" notation as in the example, rename the levels of credit_factor. Pay close attention to the level order!
Print the renamed credit_factor.

# Identify unique levels
levels(credit_factor)
[1] "AA"  "AAA" "B"   "BB"  "CCC"


# Rename the levels of credit_factor
levels(credit_factor) <- c("2A","3A", "1B", "2B", "3C")


# Print credit_factor
credit_factor
[1] 2B 3A 2A 3C 2A 3A 1B 2B
Levels: 2A 3A 1B 2B 3C
