As any good bond investor would do, you would like to keep track of how many bonds you are holding of each credit rating. A way to present a table of the counts of each bond credit rating would be great! Luckily for you, the summary() function for factors can help you with that.
The character vector credit_rating and the factor credit_factor are both in your workspace.

First call summary() on credit_rating. Does this seem useful?
Now try summary() again, but this time on credit_factor.


>
credit_rating
[1] "BB"  "AAA" "AA"  "CCC" "AA"  "AAA" "B"   "BB" 

>
credit_factor
[1] BB  AAA AA  CCC AA  AAA B   BB 
Levels: AA AAA B BB CCC


>
str(credit_factor)
 Factor w/ 5 levels "AA","AAA","B",..: 4 2 1 5 1 2 3 4
 
>
str(credit_rating)
 chr [1:8] "BB" "AAA" "AA" "CCC" "AA" "AAA" "B" "BB"
