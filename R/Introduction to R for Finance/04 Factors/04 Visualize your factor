You can also visualize the table that you created in the last example by using a bar chart. A bar chart is a type of graph that displays groups of data using rectangular bars where the height of each bar represents the number of counts in that group.
The plot() function can again take care of all of the magic for you, check it out!
Note that in the example below, you are creating the plot from a factor and not a character vector. R will throw an error if you try and plot a character vector!


The factor credit_factor is in your workspace.
Plot credit_factor to create your first bar chart!
