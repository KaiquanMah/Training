To get started, here are some of R's most basic data types:
Numerics are decimal numbers like 4.5. A special type of numeric is an integer, which is a numeric without a decimal piece. Integers must be specified like 4L.
Logicals are the boolean values TRUE and FALSE. Capital letters are important here; true and false are not valid.
Characters are text values like "hello world".


Assign the numeric 150.45 to apple_stock.
Assign the character "AAA" to credit_rating.
Answer the final question with either TRUE or FALSE, we won't judge!
