Up until now, you have been determining what data type a variable is just by looks. There is actually a better way to check this.

class(my_var)
rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.3.2/topics/class
This will return the data type (or class) of whatever variable you pass in.

The variables a, b, and c have already been defined for you. You can type ls() in the console at any time to "list" the variables currently available to you. Use the console, and class() to decide which statement below is correct.
>
class(a)
[1] "logical"
>
a
[1] TRUE
>
b
[1] 5.5
>
class(b)
[1] "numeric"
>
c
[1] "Hello World"
>
class(c)
[1] "character"
