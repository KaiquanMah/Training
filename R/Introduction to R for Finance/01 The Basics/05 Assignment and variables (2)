Suppose you have $100 stored in my_money, and your friend Dan has $200 dollars. To be clear, you decide to give Dan's money a variable name too. You want to know how much money the two of you have together. Now that each variable has a descriptive name, this is easy using the arithmetic you learned earlier:
my_money + dans_money



my_money has been defined for you.
Assign 200 to Dan's money.
Follow the example in the exercise text and add your money to Dan's money.
Add your money to Dan's money again, but this time save the result to our_money!


# Assign 100 to my_money
my_money <- 100

# Assign 200 to dans_money
dans_money <- 200

# Add my_money and dans_money
my_money + dans_money

# Add my_money and dans_money again, save the result to our_money
our_money <- my_money + dans_money









# Assign 100 to my_money
my_money <- 100
# Assign 200 to dans_money
dans_money <- 200
# Add my_money and dans_money
my_money + dans_money
[1] 300
# Add my_money and dans_money again, save the result to our_money
our_money <- my_money + dans_money
