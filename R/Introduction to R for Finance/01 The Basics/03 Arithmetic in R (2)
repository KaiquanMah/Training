The order in which you perform your mathematical operations is critical to get the correct answer. The correct sequence of "order of operation" is:

Parenthesis, Exponentiation, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction

Or PEMDAS for short!

This means that when you come along the expression: 20 - 8 * 2 , you know to do the multiplication first, then the subtraction, to get the correct answer of 4.

Which of these expressions would evaluate to 6?
4 + 8 / 2
YES       (14 - 2) / 2
(2^3 * 2) / 4
6 - 3 * 2
