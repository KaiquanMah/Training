Let's play around with your new calculator. First, check out these arithmetic operators, most of them should look familiar:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Exponentiation: ^ or **
Modulo: %%
You might be unfamiliar with the last two. The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example, 3^2 is 9. The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on the right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.

Lastly, there is another useful way to execute your code besides typing in the R Console or pressing Submit Answer. Clicking on a line of code in the script, and then pressing Command + Enter will execute just that line in the R Console. Try it out with the 2 + 2 line already in the script!




Some examples for addition, subtraction, and multiplication are shown for you.
Type 4 / 2 in the script to perform division.
Type 2^4 to raise 2 to the power of 4.
Type 7 %% 3 to calculate 7 modulo 3.
Don't forget to press Submit Answer when you finish!
