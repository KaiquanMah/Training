It is important to remember that a vector can only be composed of one data type. This means that you cannot have both a numeric and a character in the same vector. If you attempt to do this, the lower ranking type will be coerced into the higher ranking type.
For example: c(1.5, "hello") results in c("1.5", "hello") where the numeric 1.5 has been coerced into the character data type.

The hierarchy for coercion is:
logical < integer < numeric < character

Logicals are coerced a bit differently depending on what the highest data type is. 
c(TRUE, 1.5) will return c(1, 1.5) where TRUE is coerced to the numeric 1 (FALSE would be converted to a 0). 
On the other hand, c(TRUE, "this_char") is converted to c("TRUE", "this_char").

The vectors a, b, and c have been defined for you from the following commands:
a <- c(1L , "I am a character")
b <- c(TRUE, "Hello")
c <- c(FALSE, 2)

Which statement is correct about type conversion?

a is a character vector, b is an logical vector, c is a numeric vector.

a is an integer vector, b is an character vector, c is a logical vector.

YES       a is a character vector, b is a character vector, c is a numeric vector.
