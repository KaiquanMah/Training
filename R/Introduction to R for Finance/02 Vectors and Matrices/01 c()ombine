Now is where things get fun! It is time to create your first vector. Since this is a finance oriented course, it is only appropriate that your first vector be a numeric vector of stock prices. Remember, you create a vector using the combine function, c(), and each element you add is separated by a comma.

For example, this is a vector of Apple's stock prices from December, 2016:
apple_stock <- c(109.49, 109.90, 109.11, 109.95, 111.03, 112.12)

And this is a character vector of bond credit ratings:
credit_rating <- c("AAA", "AA", "BBB", "BB", "B")


Another example of a numeric vector for IBM stock prices is shown for you.
Create a character vector of the finance related words "stocks", "bonds", and "investments", in that order.
Create a logical vector of TRUE, FALSE, TRUE in that order.

# Another numeric vector
ibm_stock <- c(159.82, 160.02, 159.84)

# Another character vector
finance <- c("stocks", "bonds", "investments")

# A logical vector
logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
