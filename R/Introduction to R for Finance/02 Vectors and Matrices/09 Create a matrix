Matrices are similar to vectors, except they are in 2 dimensions! Let's create a 2x2 matrix "by hand" using matrix().
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.3.2/topics/matrix
matrix(data = c(2, 3, 4, 5), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    4
[2,]    3    5

Notice that the actual data for the matrix is passed in as a vector using c(), and is then converted to a matrix by specifying the number of rows and columns (also known as the dimensions).
Because the matrix is just created from a vector, the following is equivalent to the above code.
my_vector <- c(2, 3, 4, 5)
matrix(data = my_vector, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)



my_vector has been defined for you.
Replace the ___ to create a 3x3 matrix from my_vector.
Print my_matrix.
By default, matrices fill down each row. Run the code in the last example and note how the matrix fills across by using byrow = TRUE. Compare this to the example given above.





# A vector of 9 numbers
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

# 3x3 matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_vector, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

# Print my_matrix
my_matrix
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9



# Filling across using byrow = TRUE
matrix(data = c(2, 3, 4, 5), 
        nrow = 2, 
        ncol = 2, 
        byrow = TRUE)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    3
[2,]    4    5
