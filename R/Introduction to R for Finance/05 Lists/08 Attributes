You have made it to the last exercise in the course! Congrats! Let's finish up with an easy one.

Attributes are a bit of extra metadata about your data structure. Some of the most common attributes are: row names and column names, dimensions, and class. You can use the attributes() function to return a list of attributes about the object you pass in. To access a specific attribute, you can use the attr() function.

Exploring the attributes of cash:

attributes(cash)

$names
[1] "company"   "cash_flow" "year"     

$row.names
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

$class
[1] "data.frame"

attr(cash, which = "names")

[1] "company"   "cash_flow" "year"     



The matrix my_matrix and the factor my_factor are defined for you.
Use attributes() on my_matrix.
Use attr() on my_matrix to return the "dim" attribute.
Use attributes() on my_factor.

# my_matrix and my_factor
my_matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
rownames(my_matrix) <- c("Row1", "Row2")
colnames(my_matrix) <- c("Col1", "Col2", "Col3")
my_factor <- factor(c("A", "A", "B"), ordered = T, levels = c("A", "B"))


>my_matrix
     Col1 Col2 Col3
Row1    1    3    5
Row2    2    4    6


>my_factor
[1] A A B
Levels: A < B


# attributes of my_matrix
attributes(my_matrix)
$dim
[1] 2 3

$dimnames
$dimnames[[1]]
[1] "Row1" "Row2"

$dimnames[[2]]
[1] "Col1" "Col2" "Col3"





# Just the dim attribute of my_matrix
attr(my_matrix, which = "dim")
[1] 2 3


# attributes of my_factor
attributes(my_factor)
$levels
[1] "A" "B"

$class
[1] "ordered" "factor"
