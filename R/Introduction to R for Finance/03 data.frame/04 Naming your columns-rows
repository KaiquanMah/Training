Let's look at cash again:
cash
  comp cash yr
1    A 1000  1
2    A 4000  3
3    A  550  4
4    B 1500  1
5    B 1100  2
6    B  750  4
7    B 6000  5

Wait, that's not right! It looks like someone has changed your column names! Don't worry, you can change them back using colnames() just like you did with names() back with vectors.

Similarly, you can change the row names using rownames(), but this is less common.




The altered data frame cash is in your workspace.
Fix your column names by using colnames() and assigning a character vector of "company", "cash_flow", and "year" in that order.
Print out the fixed colnames() of cash.


# Fix your column names
colnames(cash) <- c("company", "cash_flow", "year")

# Print out the column names of cash
colnames(cash)
[1] "company"   "cash_flow" "year"
