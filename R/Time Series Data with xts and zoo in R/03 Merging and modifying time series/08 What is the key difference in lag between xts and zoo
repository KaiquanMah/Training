As you've seen, generating lags and leads are an important tool in your arsenal for handling time series data in R. However, because xts employs slightly different procedures for generating lags and leads compared with zoo of base-R, you have to be very precise in your calls to lag().

Which of the following is FALSE?
Possible Answers

The NA observations in xts resulting from lag() are preserved.

The NA observations in zoo resulting from lag() are dropped.

FALSE     The k argument in zoo uses positive values for shifting past observations forward.
SHOULD BE NEGATIVE 'k' values to shift past observations in 'zoo' forward

The k argument in xts uses positive values for shifting past observations forward.



xts follows the literature, while zoo continues with the norms of base-R.
