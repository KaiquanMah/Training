Now that you have seen how to extract the first or last chunk of a time series using natural looking language, it is only a matter of time before you need to get a bit more complex.

In this exercise, you'll extract a very specific subset of observations by linking together multiple calls to first() and last().

# Last 3 days of first week
last(first(Temps, '1 week'), '3 days') 
You will reconfigure the example above using the temps data from the previous exercise. The trick to using such a complex command is to work from the inside function, out.



Find the first three days of the second week of the temps data set. Use combinations of first() and last() to do this.
# Extract the first three days of the second week of temps
first(last(first(temps, "2 weeks"), "1 week"), "3 days")

           Temp.Max Temp.Mean Temp.Min

2016-07-05       90        79       68
2016-07-06       89        79       70
