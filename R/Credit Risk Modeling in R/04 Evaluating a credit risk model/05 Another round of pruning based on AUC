Another round of pruning based on AUC
In the video you saw how the "full" logistic regression model with a logit link was being pruned based on the AUC. You saw how the variable home_ownership was deleted from the model, as it improved the overall AUC. After repeating this process for two additional rounds, the variables age and ir_cat were deleted, leading to the model:
log_3_remove_ir <- glm(loan_status ~ loan_amnt + grade + annual_inc + emp_cat, family = binomial, data = training_set)

with an AUC of 0.6545. Now, it's your turn to see whether the AUC can still be improved by deleting another variable from the model.

Delete one variable at a time in the model log_3_remove_ir, Remember that you should be using the default link function (logit).
Make probability of default-predictions for each of the models you created.
Use function auc() using test_set$loan_status as a first argument and the predictions for each of the four models as a second argument to obtain the AUC's for each model.
Copy the name of the object (as given in the first question of this exercise) that represents the model with the best AUC.




# Build four models each time deleting one variable in log_3_remove_ir
log_4_remove_amnt <- glm(loan_status ~ grade + annual_inc + emp_cat, 
                        family = binomial, data = training_set) 
log_4_remove_grade <- glm(loan_status ~ loan_amnt + annual_inc + emp_cat, family = binomial, data = training_set)
log_4_remove_inc <- glm(loan_status ~ loan_amnt + grade + emp_cat, family = binomial, data = training_set)
log_4_remove_emp <-glm(loan_status ~ loan_amnt + grade + annual_inc, family = binomial, data = training_set)

# Make PD-predictions for each of the models
pred_4_remove_amnt <- predict(log_4_remove_amnt, newdata = test_set, type = "response")
pred_4_remove_grade <- predict(log_4_remove_grade, newdata = test_set, type = "response")
pred_4_remove_inc <- predict(log_4_remove_inc, newdata = test_set, type = "response")
pred_4_remove_emp <- predict(log_4_remove_emp, newdata = test_set, type = "response")

# Compute the AUCs
auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_amnt)
auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_grade)
auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_inc)
auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_emp)


> auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_amnt)
Area under the curve: 0.6548
> auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_grade)
Area under the curve: 0.5904
> auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_inc)
Area under the curve: 0.6401
> auc(test_set$loan_status, pred_4_remove_emp)
Area under the curve: 0.6535








Best of four
The AUC-values for the four models built in the previous exercise are stored in

AUC_4_remove_amnt 
AUC_4_remove_grade
AUC_4_remove_inc 
AUC_4_remove_emp 
Which model should be preferred based on AUC?

#yes log_4_remove_amnt
