Replacing missing data
Rather than deleting the missing interest rates, you may want to replace them instead. The object na_index, which contains the index of the observations with missing interest rates is still loaded in your workspace.


Create an object called median_ir, containing the median of the interest rates in loan_data using the median() function. Don't forget to include the argument na.rm = TRUE.
In the new data set loan_data_replace, replace all the missing instances in the indices stored in object na_index with the median of all the interest rates, median_ir.
Have a look at the variable int_rate in the new data set using summary() to make sure that the NAs are gone.


# Compute the median of int_rate
median_ir <- median(loan_data$int_rate, na.rm=TRUE)

# Make copy of loan_data
loan_data_replace <- loan_data

# Replace missing interest rates with median
loan_data_replace$int_rate[na_index] <- median_ir

# Check if the NAs are gone
summary(loan_data_replace$int_rate)

   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   5.42    8.49   10.99   11.00   13.11   23.22
