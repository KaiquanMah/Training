Creating a confusion matrix
In this example, assume that you have run a model and stored the predicted outcomes in a vector called model_pred. You want to see how the model performed so you will construct a confusion matrix. You will compare the actual loan status column (loan_status) to the predicted values (model_pred), using the table() function, where the arguments are the true values and the predicted values. Recall the confusion matrix structure:


Create a confusion matrix comparing the loan_status column in test_set with the vector model_pred. You can use the table() function with two arguments to do this. Store the matrix in object conf_matrix.
Compute the classification accuracy and print the result. You can either select the correct matrix elements from the confusion matrix using conf_matrix, or copy and paste the desired values.
Compute the sensitivity and print the result.



> conf_matrix
   model_pred
       0    1
  0 6092 2568
  1  688  349



# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- table(test_set$loan_status, model_pred)

# Compute classification accuracy
#[TP+TN] / total
(conf_matrix[2,2]+conf_matrix[1,1])/length(test_set$loan_status)
[1] 0.664226


# Compute sensitivity
#TP/ [TP+FN]
conf_matrix[2,2]/(conf_matrix[2,2]+conf_matrix[2,1])
[1] 0.3365477
