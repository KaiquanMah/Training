Interpreting a CrossTable()
How would you interpret the results in the table you constructed at the end of the previous exercise? As a reminder, here is the code for producing the CrossTable(). You can have another look at it in the R console.

CrossTable(loan_data$grade, loan_data$loan_status, prop.r = TRUE, 
           prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, prop.chisq = FALSE)


#The proportion of defaults increases when the credit rating moves from A to G.
The proportion of defaults increase with worse credit scores, as you would expect.
