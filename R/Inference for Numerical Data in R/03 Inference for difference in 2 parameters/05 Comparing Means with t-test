Hourly pay vs. citizenship status
Using the acs12 data, and specifically the variables income, hrs_work, and citizen, summarize, visualize, and compare the distributions of hourly pay rate for citizens and non-citizens.


Filter acs12 for rows where hourly pay, hrly_pay, and U.S. citizenship status, citizen, are both non-missing.
# Filter for non-missing hrly_pay and non-missing citizen
acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen <- acs12 %>%
  filter(!is.na(hrly_pay) & !is.na(citizen))







Get the number of rows in the full dataset, acs12.
Get the number of rows in the filtered dataset, acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen.
Calculate the number of rows where at least one of hrly_pay and citizen was missing.
Calculate the proportion of missing rows where at least one of hrly_pay and citizen was missing.
# Get nuber of rows in full dataset
n_all <- nrow(acs12)

# Get number of rows in filtered dataset
n_non_missing <- nrow(acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen)

# Calculate number missing
n_missing <- acs12 %>%
  filter(is.na(hrly_pay) | is.na(citizen)) %>%
  nrow()


# Calculate proportion missing
prop_missing <- n_missing/n_all

# See the result
prop_missing
[1] 0.5205

Group by U.S. citizenship status.
Summarize to calculate the mean of hourly pay, the standard deviation of hourly pay, and the number of rows in that citizenship group.
acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen %>%
  # Group by citizen
  group_by(citizen) %>%
  summarize(
    # Calculate mean hourly pay
    x_bar = mean(hrly_pay),
    # Calculate std dev of hourly pay
    s = sd(hrly_pay),
    # Count number of rows
    n = n()
  )


# A tibble: 2 x 4
  citizen     x_bar     s     n
  <chr>       <dbl> <dbl> <int>
1 Citizen      18.5  24.7   901
2 Non-citizen  21.2  34.5    58










Plot a histogram of the hrly_pay, faceted by citizenship status.
Using acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen, plot hrly_pay on the x axis.
Add a histogram layer with a binwidth of 5.

# Using acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen, plot hrly_pay
ggplot(acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen, aes(x=hrly_pay)) +
  # Add a histogram layer
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(citizen))
  
  
























Estimating the difference of two means using a t-interval
Earlier we used summary statistics and a visualization to compare the hourly pay of citizens vs. non-citizens. In this exercise we estimate the difference between the average hourly pay between these two groups.
The acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen is already loaded for you.

Run a t-test to find a confidence interval for the difference in average hourly pay, hrly_pay between citizen and non-citizens, citizen in the acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen dataset. Assign to test_results.
# Construct 95% CI using a t-test
test_results <- t.test(data=acs12_complete_hrlypay_citizen, hrly_pay ~ citizen)

# See the results
