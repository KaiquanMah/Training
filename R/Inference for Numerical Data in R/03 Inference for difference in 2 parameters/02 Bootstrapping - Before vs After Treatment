Evaluating the effectiveness of stem cell treatment (cont.)
Conduct the hypothesis test and compute the p-value for evaluating whether there is a difference between the mean heart pumping capacities of sheep's hearts in the control and treatment groups.
Since we're testing for a difference, the order in which we subtract matters. We can specify it using the order argument in the calculate() function. For example, to achieve group1 - group2 use order = c("group1", "group2").

Generate 1000 differences in means via randomization.
Specify change versus treatment group.
Use an independence hypothesis.
Generate 1000 replicates via permutation.
Calculate the difference in means (esc first, then ctrl).
n_replicates <- 1000

# Generate 1000 differences in means via randomization/permutation
diff_mean_ht <- stem.cell %>%
  # y ~ x
  specify(change ~ trmt) %>% 
  # Null = no difference between means
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  # Shuffle labels 1000 times
  generate(reps = n_replicates, type = "permute") %>% 
  # Calculate test statistic
  #https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/infer/versions/0.5.0/topics/calculate
  # stat can be "mean", "median", "sum", "sd", "prop", "count", "diff in means", "diff in medians", "diff in props", "Chisq", "F", "t", "z", "slope", and "correlation"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("esc", "ctrl"))
  
  
  
  
  
  

Calculate the one-sided p-value.
Filter for replicates where the simulated test statistic is at least as extreme as the observed statistic.
Summarize to calculate the p-value as the number of rows in the filtered dataset divided by the number of replicates.

diff_mean_ht %>%
  # Filter for simulated test statistics at least as extreme as observed
  filter(stat >= diff_mean) %>%
  # Calculate p-value
  summarise(p_val = n()/nrow(diff_mean_ht))
  
  # A tibble: 1 x 1
  p_val
  <dbl>
1     0
















Conclusion of the hypothesis test
The p-value of the previous test was found to be 0.001. Suppose the significance level of the test is 1%. Fill in the blanks:
"_ between the heart pumping capacities of sheep's hearts in the control and treatment groups."

There is a difference
There is no difference
The data provide convincing evidence that there is no difference

#yes The data provide convincing evidence of a difference
