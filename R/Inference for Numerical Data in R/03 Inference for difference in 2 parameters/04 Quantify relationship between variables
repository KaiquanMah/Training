Quantifying the relationship between smoking during pregnancy and birth weight
Let's construct a bootstrap interval for the difference in mean weights of babies born to smoker and non-smoker mothers. The ncbirths_complete_habit data frame you created earlier is available to use.


Generate 1500 bootstrap difference in means for birth weight by smoking habit.
Specify birth weight versus smoking habit.
Generate 1500 bootstrap replicates.
Calculate the difference in means, with order nonsmoker then smoker.
# Generate 1500 bootstrap difference in means
diff_mean_ci <- ncbirths_complete_habit %>%
  # Specify weight vs. habit
  specify(weight ~ habit) %>%
  # Generate 1500 bootstrap replicates
  generate(reps=1500, type="bootstrap") %>%
  # Calculate the difference in means, nonsmoker then smoker
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order=c("nonsmoker", "smoker"))




Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the bootstrap difference in mean birth weights using the percentile method.
# Calculate the 95% CI via percentile method
diff_mean_ci %>%
  summarise(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.025),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.975)
  )

# A tibble: 1 x 2
       l     u
   <dbl> <dbl>
1 0.0593 0.590


















Median lengths of pregnancies for smoking and non-smoking mothers
Let's turn our attention to another variable, weeks, indicating the length of the pregnancy. Construct a bootstrap interval for the difference in median lengths of pregnancies of smoker and non-smoker mothers.


Filter ncbirths for rows where smoking habit and length of pregnancy in weeks are both non-missing.
# Filter for non-missing habit & non-missing weeks
ncbirths_complete_habit_weeks <- ncbirths %>%
  filter(!is.na(habit) & !is.na(weeks))


Generate 1500 bootstrap difference in medians for pregnancy length in weeks by smoking habit.
Specify pregnancy length in weeks versus smoking habit.
Generate 1500 bootstrap replicates.
Calculate the difference in medians, with order nonsmoker then smoker.
# Generate 1500 bootstrap difference in medians
diff_med_ci <- ncbirths_complete_habit_weeks %>%
  # Specify weeks versus habit
  specify(weeks ~ habit) %>%
  # Generate 1500 bootstrap replicates
  generate(reps=1500, type="bootstrap") %>%
  # Calculate the difference in medians, nonsmoker then smoker
  calculate(stat="diff in medians", order=c("nonsmoker", "smoker"))
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Calculate a 92% confidence interval for the bootstrap difference in median pregnancy length in weeks using the percentile method.
# Calculate the 92% CI via percentile method
diff_med_ci %>%
  summarize(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.04),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.96)
  )

# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1     0     1


Quick mental check before you move on: What does 92% confident mean?
