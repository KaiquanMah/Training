SE of the slope
The previous exercise generated 10 different slopes under a model of no (i.e., null) relationship between the explanatory and response variables. Now repeat the null slope calculations 1000 times to derive a null sampling distribution for the slope coefficient. The null sampling distribution will be used as a benchmark against which to compare the original data. Then, you'll calculate the mean and standard deviation of the null sampling distribution for the slope.


Simulate 500 slopes.
Use specify() to specify Foster vs. Biological (same formula as for a linear regression).
Use hypothesize(), to set a null hypothesis of "independence".
Use generate() to generate 500 replicates (reps) of type "permute".
Use calculate() to calculate the summary statistic "slope".

# Simulate 500 slopes with a permuted dataset
perm_slope <- twins %>%
  # Specify Foster vs. Biological
  specify(Foster ~ Biological) %>%
  # Use a null hypothesis of independence
  hypothesize(null="independence") %>%
  # Generate 500 permutation replicates
  generate(reps=500, type="permute") %>%
  # Calculate the slope statistic
  calculate(stat="slope") 
  









Using the perm_slope data, plot the stat you calculated with a density geom.
# Using perm_slope, plot stat
ggplot(perm_slope, aes(x=stat)) + 
  # Add a density layer
  geom_density()





Use ungroup() without arguments to ungroup the dataset.
Use summarize() to calculate summary statistics.
Calculate mean_stat as the mean of stat.
Calculate std_err_stat as the standard error of stat, using sd().

# From previous step
perm_slope <- twins %>%
  specify(Foster ~ Biological) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 500, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "slope")

perm_slope %>% 
  # Ungroup the dataset
  ungroup() %>% 
  # Calculate summary statistics
  summarise(
    # Mean of stat
    mean_stat = mean(stat), 
    # Std error of stat
    std_err_stat = sd(stat)
  )
  
# A tibble: 1 x 2
  mean_stat std_err_stat
      <dbl>        <dbl>
1   0.00692        0.191  

Notice that the distribution of slopes is centered close to zero, and ranges from about -0.5 to 0.5.
