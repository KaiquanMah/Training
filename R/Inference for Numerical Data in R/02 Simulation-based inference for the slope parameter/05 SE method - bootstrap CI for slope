SE method - bootstrap CI for slope
The twins study was used to weigh in on the question of whether IQ is a result of nature (your genes) or nurture (your environment). If IQ was purely a result of nature, what slope would you expect to see in your linear model?
Recall that one way to create a confidence interval for a statistic is to calculate the statistic repeatedly under different bootstrap samples and to find the standard deviation associated with the bootstrapped statistics.
The twins data is already loaded in your workspace.

As with the previous exercise, use the infer steps on the twins data to specify a Foster vs. Biological model, generate 1000 bootstrapped replicates, and calculate the slope statistic.
Calculate the confidence interval of stat as the mean plus or minus two standard deviations.

set.seed(4747)

# Calculate the slope statistic 
# from 1000 bootstrap replicates of
# the Foster vs. Biological model
# of the twins dataset
boot_slope <- twins %>%
  specify(Foster ~ Biological) %>%
  generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="slope")


# Create a confidence interval of stat
# 2 std devs each side of the mean
boot_slope %>% 
  summarize(
    lower = mean(stat) - 2*sd(stat),
    upper = mean(stat) + 2*sd(stat)
  )


# A tibble: 1 x 2
  lower upper
