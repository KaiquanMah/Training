ANOVA for vocabulary score vs. (self identified) social class
Let's conduct the ANOVA for evaluating whether there is a difference in the average vocabulary scores between the levels of (self identified) social class.


Run the ANOVA with the aov() function, and store the resulting object as aov_wordsum_class.
View a tidy() output of this object.
Interpret the result in context of the data and the research question. Use a 5% significance level.

# Run an analysis of variance on wordsum vs. class
aov_wordsum_class <- aov(wordsum ~ class, data=gss)

# Tidy the model
tidy(aov_wordsum_class)

# A tibble: 2 x 6
