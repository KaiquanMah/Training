EDA for vocabulary score vs. social class
Before we conduct inference, we should take a look at the distributions of vocabulary scores across the levels of (self identified) social class.


Using gss, plot the distribution of vocabulary scores, wordsum.
Make this a histogram, using an appropriate binwidth.
Facet this histogram, wrapping by social class level.
Look at the plot! Compare the distributions of vocabulary scores across the levels of (self identified) social class.

# Using gss, plot wordsum
ggplot(gss, mapping = aes(x=wordsum)) +
  # Add a histogram layer
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  # Facet by class
  facet_wrap(~class)
  
  
Great start to the last chapter! Before you move on, make sure you've compared all attributes of the distributions: shape, center, spread, unusual observations.

  













Comparing many means, visually
Which of the following plots shows groups with means that are most and least likely to be significantly different from each other?

Most likely: 1, least likely: 2
Correct! The bars in facet 1 look different to each other, so they are more likely to be significantly different to each other.
