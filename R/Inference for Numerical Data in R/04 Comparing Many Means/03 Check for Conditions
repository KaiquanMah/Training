Checking the normality condition
Which of the following provides the most complete information for checking the normality condition for the ANOVA for evaluating whether there are differences between the average vocabulary scores across social classes?


Box plot of vocabulary scores, faceted by social class
Means and standard deviations of vocabulary scores in each social class
Number of modes of vocabulary scores in each social class

#yes Histogram of vocabulary scores, faceted by social class
Correct! A histogram shows you the shape of the distribution.










Checking the constant variance condition
In addition to checking the normality of distributions of vocabulary scores across levels of social class, we need to check that the variances from each are roughly constant.


Group by social class.
Summarize to calculate the standard deviations of vocabulary scores, storing in a column named std_dev_wordsum.
Verify the constant variance condition.

gss %>%
  # Group by class
  group_by(class) %>%
  # Calculate the std dev of wordsum as std_dev_wordsum
  summarise(std_dev_wordsum = sd(wordsum))


# A tibble: 4 x 2
  class   std_dev_wordsum
  <chr>             <dbl>
1 LOWER              2.24
2 MIDDLE             1.89
3 UPPER              2.34
4 WORKING            1.87
