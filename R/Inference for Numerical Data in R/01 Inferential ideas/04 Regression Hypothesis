Regression hypothesis
A regression is run to investigate whether additional hours studied (the explanatory variable) is associated with a higher exam score (the response variable). Should the researchers run a test with a one- or two-sided alternative hypothesis?

one-sided because the researchers know studying leads to higher test scores.
two-sided because the researchers have no pre-conceived notion of whether or not studying is associated with test scores.
two-sided because the researchers don't want to perform data-snooping.

#yes one-sided because the researchers are trying to demonstrate a positive association.
Right! If the researchers were interested in investigating whether exam scores were higher or lower, then they should use a two-sided alternative hypothesis.
