Test for median price of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan
Let's turn our attention back to Manhattan apartments. We would like to evaluate whether this data provides evidence that the median rent of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan is greater than $2,500.

Generate 15000 bootstrap samples centered at null. The specify, generate, and calculate steps are completed for you.
Set a point null hypothesis with a median of 2500.
n_replicates <- 15000

# Generate 15000 bootstrap samples centered at null
rent_med_ht <- manhattan %>%
  specify(response = rent) %>%
  # Use a point hypothesis with a median of 2500
  hypothesize(null = "point", med = 2500) %>% 
  generate(reps = n_replicates, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "median")
  
# See the result
rent_med_ht
Response: rent (integer)
# A tibble: 15,000 x 2
   replicate  stat
       <int> <dbl>
 1         1 2572.
 2         2 2500 
 3         3 2312.
...





Calculate the observed median rent.
Summarize to calculate the median rent.
Pull out the value.

# A tibble: 20 x 1

 2  3800
 3  2350
 4  3200

 rent_med_obs <- manhattan %>%
  # Calculate observed median rent
  summarise(median_rent = median(rent)) %>%
  # Pull out the value
  pull()
  
# See the result
rent_med_obs

Calculate the p-value as the proportion of bootstrap statistics greater than the observed statistic.
Filter for rows where the bootstrap median is greater than or equal to the observed median.
Summarize to calculate p_val as the number of rows in the filtered dataset divided by the number of replicates.

rent_med_ht %>%
  # Filter for bootstrap stat greater than or equal to observed stat
  filter(stat >= rent_med_obs) %>%
  # Calculate the p-value
  summarize(p_val = n()/nrow(rent_med_ht))
  
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  p_val
  <dbl>
1 0.948  
  
  
Well, turns out the prices of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan aren't too bad ;)













Conclude the hypothesis test on median
The p-value you calculated in the previous exercise is available as rent_p_value. Recall the problem statement: We would like to evaluate whether this data provides evidence that the median rent of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan is greater than $2,500. What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test at the 5% significance level?

We reject H0 since the p-value is above the significance level, and conclude that the data provide convincing evidence that median rent of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan is greater than $2500.
We fail to reject H0 since the p-value is above the significance level, and conclude that the data provide convincing evidence that median rent of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan is greater than $2500.
We reject H0 since the p-value is below the significance level, and conclude that the data do not provide convincing evidence that median rent of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan is greater than $2500.

#yes We fail to reject H0 since the p-value is above the significance level, and conclude that the data do not provide convincing evidence that median rent of 1 BR apartments in Manhattan is greater than $2500.
Correct! The p-value is above the significance level, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis.
