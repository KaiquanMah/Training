When to t?
Which of the following describes best why we might need to use the t-distribution for inference?

#yes population standard deviation is unknown

population distribution is not known
sample is not random
sample is not representative of the population












Probabilities under the t-distribution
We can use the pt() function to find probabilities under the t-distribution. For a given cutoff value q and a given degrees of freedom df, pt(q, df) gives us the probability under the t-distribution with df degrees of freedom for values of t less than q. In other words, P(t@df < T) = pt(q = T, df).

Find the probability under the t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom below T=3.
Find the probability under the t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom above T=3.
Find the probability under the t-distribution with 100 degrees of freedom above T=3.
How do the last two probabilities compare? Why?

# P(T < 3) for df = 10
(x <- pt(3, df = 10))
[1] 0.9933282

# P(T > 3) for df = 10
(y <- 1-pt(3, df = 10))
[1] 0.006671828

# P(T > 3) for df = 100
(z <- 1-pt(3, df = 100))
[1] 0.001703958

# Comparison
> y == z
[1] FALSE
> y > z
[1] TRUE
> y < z
[1] FALSE

Do your findings agree with the statement in the video that as the degrees of freedom increases the area in the tails decreases?











Cutoffs under the t-distribution
We can use the qt() function to find cutoffs under the t-distribution. For a given probability p and a given degrees of freedom df, qt(p, df) gives us the cutoff value for the t-distribution with df degrees of freedom for which the probability under the curve is p. In other words, if P(tdf<T)=p, then T = qt(p, df). For example, if T corresponds to the 95th percentile of a distribution, p=0.95. The "middle 95%" means from p = 0.025 to p = 0.975.

Find the 95th percentile of the t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom.
Find the cutoff value that bounds the upper end of the middle 95th percent of the t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom.
Find the cutoff value that bounds the upper end of the middle 95th percent of the t-distribution with 100 degrees of freedom.
How do the last values probabilities compare? Based on your findings, is the middle 95% of the t-distribution wider for lower or higher degrees of freedom?

# 95th percentile for df = 10
(x <- qt(p=0.95, df = 10))
[1] 1.812461

# Upper bound of middle 95th percent for df = 10
(y <- qt(0.975, df = 10))
[1] 2.228139

# Upper bound of middle 95th percent for df = 100
(z <- qt(0.975, df = 100))
[1] 1.983972

# Comparison
> y == z
[1] FALSE
> y > z
[1] TRUE
> y < z
[1] FALSE
