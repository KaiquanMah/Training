Doctor visits during pregnancy
The state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. The ncbirths dataset (which is already loaded for you) is a random sample of 1000 cases from this data set. Among other variables, the number of doctor's visits (visits) the mother had throughout the pregnancy is recorded. Which of the following is false about the distribution of visits?

On average, mothers visit the doctor approximately 12 times throughout pregnancy.
The distribution of number of doctor's visits is unimodal and roughly symmetric.
The median number of doctor's visits throughout the pregnancy is roughly equal to the mean number of visits.

#false The number of doctor's visits for one of the mothers in the dataset is missing.
Correct! Filtering the dataset for is.na(visits) values reveals missing values for several mothers.
