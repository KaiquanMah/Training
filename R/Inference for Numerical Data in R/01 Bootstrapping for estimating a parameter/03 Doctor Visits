Doctor visits during pregnancy
The state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. The ncbirths dataset (which is already loaded for you) is a random sample of 1000 cases from this data set. Among other variables, the number of doctor's visits (visits) the mother had throughout the pregnancy is recorded. Which of the following is false about the distribution of visits?

On average, mothers visit the doctor approximately 12 times throughout pregnancy.
The distribution of number of doctor's visits is unimodal and roughly symmetric.
The median number of doctor's visits throughout the pregnancy is roughly equal to the mean number of visits.

#false The number of doctor's visits for one of the mothers in the dataset is missing.
Correct! Filtering the dataset for is.na(visits) values reveals missing values for several mothers.

Average number of doctor's visits
Next, we construct a bootstrap interval for the average number of doctor's visits during pregnancy.

Filter ncbirths for rows where visits is not missing.
# Filter for rows with non-missing visits
ncbirths_complete_visits <- ncbirths %>%
  filter(visits != 'NA')
  
# See the result
glimpse(ncbirths_complete_visits)










Generate 15000 bootstrap means of the number of visits.
Specify visits as the variable of interest.
Generate 15000 bootstrap replicates.
Calculate the mean.

# Generate 15000 bootstrap means
visit_mean_ci <- ncbirths_complete_visits %>%
  # Specify visits as the response
  specify(response = visits) %>%
  # Generate 15000 bootstrap replicates
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  # Calculate the mean
  calculate(stat = "mean")







Calculate the 90% confidence interval via percentile method.
Summarize to calculate appropriate quantiles of the bootstrap statistic.
# Calculate the 90% CI via percentile method
visit_mean_ci %>%
  summarize(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.05),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.95)
  )

# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1  11.9  12.3


Quick mental check before you move on: How would you interpret this interval?
























SD of number of doctor's visits
Suppose now we're interested in the standard deviation of the number of doctor's visits throughout pregnancy.

For the number of doctor's visits, generate 15000 bootstrap replicates and calculate their standard deviations.

# Calculate 15000 bootstrap standard deviations of visits
visit_sd_ci <- ncbirths_complete_visits %>%
  specify(response=visits) %>%
  generate(reps=15000, type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="sd")
  
# See the result
visit_sd_ci
Response: visits (integer)
# A tibble: 15,000 x 2
   replicate  stat
       <int> <dbl>
 1         1  3.97
 2         2  3.94



Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the bootstrap standard deviations using the percentile method.
# Calculate the 90% CI via percentile method
visit_sd_ci %>%
  summarise(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.05),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.95)
  )
