Calculate bootstrap interval using both methods
Using our bootstrap distribution from an earlier exercise, we can calculate bootstrap intervals for the median price of 1 bedroom apartments in Manhattan. Remember that we saved the bootstrap distribution as rent_med_ci.


Calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval using the percentile method.
Summarize rent_med_ci's statistic with appropriate lower and upper quantiles.
# Calculate bootstrap CI as lower and upper quantiles
rent_med_ci %>%
  summarize(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.025),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.975)
  ) 


# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1 2162.  2875







Calculate the observed median rent.
Summarize to calculate the median rent.
Pull out the value.
rent_med_obs <- manhattan %>%
  # Calculate observed median rent
  summarise(median_rent = median(rent)) %>%
  # Pull out the value
  pull()
  
# See the result
rent_med_obs
[1] 2350








Determine the critical value.
Calculate the degrees of freedom in the dataset.
Use the t-distribution to determine the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. qt() takes the percentile of the t-distribution you want to find and the degrees of freedom as arguments.
# Calculate the degrees of freedom
degrees_of_freedom <- nrow(manhattan)-1
  
  
# Determine the critical value
#https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/TDist.html
#t_star <- qt(c(0.025, 0.975), degrees_of_freedom)
t_star <- qt(p=c(0.975), df=degrees_of_freedom)

> degrees_of_freedom
[1] 19
> t_star
[1] 2.093024









Complete the calculation of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval using the standard error method.
Summarize to calculate the standard error of the bootstrap medians.
Summarize again to calculate the lower and upper limits of the CI.
Compare the interval to the one you calculated in step 1.
# Calculate the CI using the std error method
rent_med_ci %>%
  # Calculate the std error of the statistic
  summarize(boot_se = sd(stat)) %>%
  # Calculate the lower and upper limits of the CI
  summarize(
    l = rent_med_obs - t_star * boot_se,
    u = rent_med_obs + t_star * boot_se
  )

# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1 2000. 2700.



# Recall the CI using the percentile method from step 1
rent_med_ci %>%
  summarize(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.025),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.975)
  )

# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1 2162.  2875
The standard error method sure is more work, but often it provides a better estimate.
