Calculate bootstrap interval using both methods
Using our bootstrap distribution from an earlier exercise, we can calculate bootstrap intervals for the median price of 1 bedroom apartments in Manhattan. Remember that we saved the bootstrap distribution as rent_med_ci.


Calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval using the percentile method.
Summarize rent_med_ci's statistic with appropriate lower and upper quantiles.
# Calculate bootstrap CI as lower and upper quantiles
rent_med_ci %>%
  summarize(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.025),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.975)
  ) 


# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1 2162.  2875







Calculate the observed median rent.
Summarize to calculate the median rent.
Pull out the value.
rent_med_obs <- manhattan %>%
  # Calculate observed median rent
  summarise(median_rent = median(rent)) %>%
  # Pull out the value
  pull()
  
# See the result
rent_med_obs
[1] 2350








Determine the critical value.
Calculate the degrees of freedom in the dataset.
Use the t-distribution to determine the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. qt() takes the percentile of the t-distribution you want to find and the degrees of freedom as arguments.
# Calculate the degrees of freedom
degrees_of_freedom <- nrow(manhattan)-1
  
  
# Determine the critical value
#https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/TDist.html
#t_star <- qt(c(0.025, 0.975), degrees_of_freedom)
t_star <- qt(p=c(0.975), df=degrees_of_freedom)

> degrees_of_freedom
[1] 19
> t_star
[1] 2.093024









Complete the calculation of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval using the standard error method.
Summarize to calculate the standard error of the bootstrap medians.
Summarize again to calculate the lower and upper limits of the CI.
Compare the interval to the one you calculated in step 1.
# Calculate the CI using the std error method
rent_med_ci %>%
  # Calculate the std error of the statistic
  summarize(boot_se = sd(stat)) %>%
  # Calculate the lower and upper limits of the CI
  summarize(
    l = rent_med_obs - t_star * boot_se,
    u = rent_med_obs + t_star * boot_se
  )

# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1 2000. 2700.



# Recall the CI using the percentile method from step 1
rent_med_ci %>%
  summarize(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.025),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.975)
  )

# A tibble: 1 x 2
      l     u
  <dbl> <dbl>
1 2162.  2875
The standard error method sure is more work, but often it provides a better estimate.

Doctor visits during pregnancy
The state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. The ncbirths dataset (which is already loaded for you) is a random sample of 1000 cases from this data set. Among other variables, the number of doctor's visits (visits) the mother had throughout the pregnancy is recorded. Which of the following is false about the distribution of visits?

On average, mothers visit the doctor approximately 12 times throughout pregnancy.
The distribution of number of doctor's visits is unimodal and roughly symmetric.
The median number of doctor's visits throughout the pregnancy is roughly equal to the mean number of visits.

#false The number of doctor's visits for one of the mothers in the dataset is missing.
Correct! Filtering the dataset for is.na(visits) values reveals missing values for several mothers.
