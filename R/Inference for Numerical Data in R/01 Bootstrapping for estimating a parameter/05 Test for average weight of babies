Test for average weight of babies
We'll wrap up inference on a single parameter of a numerical distribution by revisiting the ncbirths dataset, specifically the weight variable, indicating the birth weight of the baby. Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average birth weight of babies born in North Carolina is different than 7 pounds?


Calculate 1500 bootstrap replicates of the mean weight. Use a point null hypothesis of weights being mu = 7 pounds.
n_replicates <- 1500

weight_mean_ht <- ncbirths %>%
  # Specify weight as the response
  specify(response=weight) %>%
  # Set the hypothesis that weights are 7 pounds
  hypothesize(null="point", mu=7) %>% 
  # Generate 1500 bootstrap replicates
  generate(reps=1500, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  # Calculate the mean
  calculate(stat="mean")




Calculate the mean observed weight and pull out the value.
# Calculate observed mean
weight_mean_obs <- ncbirths %>%
  # Summarize to calculate the mean observed weight
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>% 
  # Pull out the value
  pull()



Calculate the two-sided p-value.
Filter for rows where the bootstrap median is greater than or equal to the observed median.
Summarize to calculate one_sided_p_val as the number of rows in the filtered dataset divided by the number of replicates.
Calculate two_sided_p_val from one_sided_p_val.

# Calculate p-value
weight_mean_ht %>%
  # Filter on stat greater than or equal to weight_mean_obs
  filter(stat >= weight_mean_obs) %>%
  # p_val is twice the number of filtered rows divided by the total number of rows
  summarize(
    one_sided_p_val = n() / nrow(weight_mean_ht),
    two_sided_p_val = 2 * one_sided_p_val
  )
