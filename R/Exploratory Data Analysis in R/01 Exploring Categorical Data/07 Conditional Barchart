Conditional barchart
Now, if you want to break down the distribution of alignment based on gender, you're looking for conditional distributions.

You could make these by creating multiple filtered datasets (one for each gender) or by faceting the plot of alignment based on gender. As a point of comparison, we've provided your plot of the marginal distribution of alignment from the last exercise.




Create a barchart of align faceted by gender.

# Plot of alignment broken down by gender
ggplot(comics, aes(x = align)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ gender)
