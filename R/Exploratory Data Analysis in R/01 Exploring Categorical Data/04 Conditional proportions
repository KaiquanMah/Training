Conditional proportions
The following code generates tables of joint and conditional proportions, respectively:

tab <- table(comics$align, comics$gender)
options(scipen = 999, digits = 3) # Print fewer digits
prop.table(tab)     # Joint proportions
prop.table(tab, 2)  # Conditional on columns
Go ahead and run it in the console. Approximately what proportion of all female characters are good?
51%


> prop.table(tab)     # Joint proportions
+ 
         
            Female     Male    Other
  Bad     0.082210 0.395160 0.001672
  Good    0.130135 0.251333 0.000888
  Neutral 0.043692 0.094021 0.000888
  
  
  > prop.table(tab, 2)  # Conditional on columns
+ 
         
          Female  Male Other
  Bad      0.321 0.534 0.485
  Good     0.508 0.339 0.258
  Neutral  0.171 0.127 0.258
  
  
To answer this question, you needed to look at how align was distributed within each gender. That is, you wanted to condition on the gender variable.
