Side-by-side barcharts
While a contingency table represents the counts numerically, it's often more useful to represent them graphically.

Here you'll construct two side-by-side barcharts of the comics data. This shows that there can often be two or more options for presenting the same data. Passing the argument position = "dodge" to geom_bar() says that you want a side-by-side (i.e. not stacked) barchart.





Load the ggplot2 package.
Create a side-by-side barchart with align on the x-axis and gender as the fill aesthetic.
Create another side-by-side barchart with gender on the x-axis and align as the fill aesthetic. Rotate the axis labels 90 degrees to help readability.


# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Create side-by-side barchart of gender by alignment
ggplot(comics, aes(x = align, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

# Create side-by-side barchart of alignment by gender
ggplot(comics, aes(x = gender, fill = align)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
  
  







Bar chart interpretation
Which of the following interpretations of the bar charts to your right is not valid?

#not Among characters with "Neutral" alignment, males are the most common.
#not In general, there is an association between gender and alignment.

#yes Across all genders, "Bad" is the most common alignment.

#not There are more male characters than female characters in this dataset.
