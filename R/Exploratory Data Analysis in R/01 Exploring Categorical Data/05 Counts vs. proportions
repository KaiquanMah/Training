Counts vs. proportions (2)
Bar charts can tell dramatically different stories depending on whether they represent counts or proportions and, if proportions, what the proportions are conditioned on. To demonstrate this difference, you'll construct two barcharts in this exercise: one of counts and one of proportions.



Create a stacked barchart of gender counts with align on the x-axis.
Create a stacked barchart of gender proportions with align on the x-axis by setting the position argument to geom_bar() equal to "fill".


# Plot of gender by align
#not stacking till every bar ends at the top
ggplot(comics, aes(x = align, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar()
  
# Plot proportion of gender, conditional on align
#stack till every bar ends at the top - proportion of 1.0
ggplot(comics, aes(x = align, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ylab("proportion")
  
  
  


By adding position = "fill" to geom_bar(), you are saying you want the bars to fill the entire height of the plotting window, thus displaying proportions and not raw counts.
