Bar chart expectations
Suppose you've asked 30 people, some young, some old, what their preferred flavor of pie is: apple or pumpkin. That data could be summarized in a side-by-side barchart. Here are three possibilities for how it might look.

Which one of the barcharts shows no relationship between age and flavor? In other words, which shows that pie preference is the same for both young and old?

Contingency table review
In this chapter you'll continue working with the comics dataset introduced in the video. This is a collection of characteristics on all of the superheroes created by Marvel and DC comics in the last 80 years.

Let's start by creating a contingency table, which is a useful way to represent the total counts of observations that fall into each combination of the levels of categorical variables.







The dataset has been loaded into your workspace as comics.

Type the name of the dataset to look at the rows and columns of the dataset.
View the levels() that the align variable can take.
View the levels() that the gender variable can take.
Create a contingency table of the same two variables.
