Describe the shape
To build some familiarity with distributions of different shapes, consider the four that are plotted here. Which of the following options does the best job of describing their shape in terms of modality and skew/symmetry?

A: unimodal left-skewed; B: unimodal symmetric; C: unimodal right-skewed, D: bimodal symmetric.






Transformations
Highly skewed distributions can make it very difficult to learn anything from a visualization. Transformations can be helpful in revealing the more subtle structure.

Here you'll focus on the population variable, which exhibits strong right skew, and transform it with the natural logarithm function (log() in R).



Using the gap2007 data:
Create a density plot of the population variable.
Mutate a new column called log_pop that is the natural log of the population and save it back into gap2007.
Create a density plot of your transformed variable.
