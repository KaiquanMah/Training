Choice of spread measure
The choice of measure for spread can dramatically impact how variable we consider our data to be, so it is important that you consider the shape of the distribution before deciding on the measure.

Which set of measures of spread would be worst for describing the two distributions shown here?

#not A: IQR, B: IQR
#not A: SD, B: IQR

#yes  A: Variance, B: Range
A is right skewed and a wider variance







Calculate spread measures
Let's extend the powerful group_by() and summarize() syntax to measures of spread. If you're unsure whether you're working with symmetric or skewed distributions, it's a good idea to consider a robust measure like IQR in addition to the usual measures of variance or standard deviation.




The gap2007 dataset that you created in an earlier exercise is available in your workspace.

For each continent in gap2007, summarize life expectancies using the sd(), the IQR(), and the count of countries, n(). No need to name the new columns produced here. The n() function within your summarize() call does not take any arguments.
Graphically compare the spread of these distributions by constructing overlaid density plots of life expectancy broken down by continent.
