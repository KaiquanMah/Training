Choose measures for center and spread
Consider the density plots shown here. What are the most appropriate measures to describe their centers and spreads? In this exercise, you'll select the measures and then calculate them.




Using the shapes of the density plots, calculate the most appropriate measures of center and spread for the following:

The distribution of life expectancy in the countries of the Americas. Note you'll need to apply a filter here.
The distribution of country populations across the entire gap2007 dataset.

# Compute stats for population
# distribution has a very long right tail; right skew; so try to focus on the centre of the distribution
# distribution also has large values without 'logging' them
gap2007 %>%
  summarize(median(pop),
            IQR(pop))
# A tibble: 1 x 2
  `median(pop)` `IQR(pop)`

Like mean and standard deviation, median and IQR measure the central tendency and spread, respectively, but are robust to outliers and non-normal data.
