Choice of center measure
The choice of measure for center can have a dramatic impact on what we consider to be a typical observation, so it is important that you consider the shape of the distribution before deciding on the measure.

Which set of measures of central tendency would be worst for describing the two distributions shown here?

#not A: mode, B: median

#yes A: mean, B: mode
as A is right skewed

#not A: median, B: mean
#not A: median, B: median













Calculate center measures
Throughout this chapter, you will use data from gapminder, which tracks demographic data in countries of the world over time. To learn more about it, you can bring up the help file with ?gapminder.

For this exercise, focus on how the life expectancy differs from continent to continent. This requires that you conduct your analysis not at the country level, but aggregated up to the continent level. This is made possible by the one-two punch of group_by() and summarize(), a very powerful syntax for carrying out the same analysis on different subsets of the full dataset.




Create a dataset called gap2007 that contains only data from the year 2007.
Using gap2007, calculate the mean and median life expectancy for each continent. Don't worry about naming the new columns produced by summarize().
Confirm the trends that you see in the medians by generating side-by-side box plots of life expectancy for each continent.
