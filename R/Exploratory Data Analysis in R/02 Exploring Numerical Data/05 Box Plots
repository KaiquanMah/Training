Box plots for outliers
In addition to indicating the center and spread of a distribution, a box plot provides a graphical means to detect outliers. You can apply this method to the msrp column (manufacturer's suggested retail price) to detect if there are unusually expensive or cheap cars.


Construct a box plot of msrp.
Exclude the largest 3-5 outliers by filtering the rows to retain cars less than $100,000. Save this reduced dataset as cars_no_out.
Construct a similar box plot of msrp using this reduced dataset. Compare the two plots.

# Construct box plot of msrp
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = msrp)) +
  geom_boxplot()


# Exclude outliers from data
cars_no_out <- cars %>%
  filter(msrp < 100000)


# Construct box plot of msrp using the reduced dataset
cars_no_out %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=1, y=msrp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
