Marginal and conditional histograms
Now, turn your attention to a new variable: horsepwr. The goal is to get a sense of the marginal distribution of this variable and then compare it to the distribution of horsepower conditional on the price of the car being less than $25,000.

You'll be making two plots using the "data pipeline" paradigm, where you start with the raw data and end with the plot.




Create a histogram of the distribution of horsepwr across all cars and add an appropriate title. Start by piping in the raw dataset.
Create a second histogram of the distribution of horsepower, but only for those cars that have an msrp less than $25,000. Keep the limits of the x-axis so that they're similar to that of the first plot, and add a descriptive title.



# Create hist of horsepwr
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Horsepower")

# Create hist of horsepwr for affordable cars
cars %>% 
  filter(msrp < 25000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(c(90, 550)) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Horsepower For Prices < $25,000")
  







Marginal and conditional histograms interpretation
Observe the two histograms in the plotting window and decide which of the following is a valid interpretation.



#NOT Cars with around 300 horsepower are more common than cars with around 200 horsepower.

#YES The highest horsepower car in the less expensive range has just under 250 horsepower.

#NOT Most cars under $25,000 vary from roughly 100 horsepower to roughly 350 horsepower.
