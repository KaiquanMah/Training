3 variable plot
Faceting is a valuable technique for looking at several conditional distributions at the same time. If the faceted distributions are laid out in a grid, you can consider the association between a variable and two others, one on the rows of the grid and the other on the columns.


common_cyl, which you created to contain only cars with 4, 6, or 8 cylinders, is available in your workspace.

Using common_cyl, create a histogram of hwy_mpg.
Grid-facet the plot rowwise by ncyl and columnwise by suv.
Add a title to your plot to indicate what variables are being faceted on.


# Facet hists using hwy mileage and ncyl
common_cyl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hwy_mpg)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(ncyl ~ suv) +
  ggtitle("Row facets: Number of Cylinders, Column facets: SUV")
  



Interpret 3 var plot
Which of the following interpretations of the plot is valid?

#YES Across both SUVs and non-SUVs, mileage tends to decrease as the number of cylinders increases.

#NOT There are more SUVs than non-SUVs across all cylinder types.
#NOT There is more variability in 6-cylinder non-SUVs than in any other type of car.
