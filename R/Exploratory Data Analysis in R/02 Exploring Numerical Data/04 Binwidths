Three binwidths
Before you take these plots for granted, it's a good idea to see how things change when you alter the binwidth. The binwidth determines how smooth your distribution will appear: the smaller the binwidth, the more jagged your distribution becomes. It's good practice to consider several binwidths in order to detect different types of structure in your data.



Create the following three plots, adding a title to each to indicate the binwidth used:

A histogram of horsepower (i.e. horsepwr) with a binwidth of 3.
A second histogram of horsepower with a binwidth of 30.
A third histogram of horsepower with a binwidth of 60.



# Create hist of horsepwr with binwidth of 3
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Horsepower with Binwidth of 3")

# Create hist of horsepwr with binwidth of 30
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Horsepower with Binwidth of 30")

# Create hist of horsepwr with binwidth of 60
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 60) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Horsepower with Binwidth of 60")





Three binwidths interpretation
What feature is present in Plot A that's not found in B or C?

#NOT The most common horsepower is around 200.
It seems like Plot B and Plot C have peaks around 200.


#YES There is a tendency for cars to have horsepower right at 200 or 300 horsepower.
Plot A is the only histogram that shows the count for cars with exactly 200 and 300 horsepower.


#NOT There is a second mode around 300 horsepower.
It looks like Plot B and Plot C have a second mode around 300 horsepower, too.
