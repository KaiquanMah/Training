Spam and !!!
Let's look at a more obvious indicator of spam: exclamation marks. exclaim_mess contains the number of exclamation marks in each message. Using summary statistics and visualization, see if there is a relationship between this variable and whether or not a message is spam.

Experiment with different types of plots until you find one that is the most informative. Recall that you've seen:

Side-by-side box plots
Faceted histograms
Overlaid density plots




The email dataset is still available in your workspace.

Calculate appropriate measures of the center and spread of exclaim_mess for both spam and not-spam using group_by() and summarize().
Construct an appropriate plot to visualize the association between the same two variables, adding in a log-transformation step if necessary.
If you decide to use a log transformation, remember that log(0) is -Inf in R, which isn't a very useful value! You can get around this by adding a small number (like 0.01) to the quantity inside the log() function. This way, your value is never zero. This small shift to the right won't affect your results.

Spam and !!! interpretation
Which interpretation of these faceted histograms is not correct?


#correct The most common value of exclaim_mess in both classes of email is zero (a log(exclaim_mess) of -4.6 after adding .01).

#not correct There are more cases of spam in this dataset than not-spam.


#correct Even after a transformation, the distribution of exclaim_mess in both classes of email is right-skewed.
#correctThe typical number of exclamations in the not-spam group appears to be slightly higher than in the spam group.
