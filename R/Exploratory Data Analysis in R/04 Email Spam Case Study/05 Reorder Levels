What's in a number?
Turn your attention to the variable called number. Read more about it by pulling up the help file with ?email.

To explore the association between this variable and spam, select and construct an informative plot. For illustrating relationships between categorical variables, you've seen
Faceted barcharts
Side-by-side barcharts
Stacked and normalized barcharts.

Let's practice constructing a faceted barchart.

Indicator for whether the email was addressed to more than one recipient.

Reorder the levels of number so that they preserve the natural ordering of "none", then "small", then "big", saving to a number_reordered column.
Construct a faceted barchart of the association between number and spam.

# Reorder levels
email$number_reordered <- factor(email$number,
                              levels=c("none","small","big"))


# Construct plot of number_reordered
ggplot(email, aes(x=number_reordered)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ spam)

















What's in a number interpretation
Which of the following interpretations of the plot is not valid?

#valid Given that an email contains a small number, it is more likely to be not-spam.

#not valid Given that an email contains no number, it is more likely to be spam.

#valid Given that an email contains a big number, it is more likely to be not-spam.
#valid Within both spam and not-spam, the most common number is a small one.
