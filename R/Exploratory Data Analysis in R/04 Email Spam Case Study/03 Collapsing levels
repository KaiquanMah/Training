Collapsing levels
If it was difficult to work with the heavy skew of exclaim_mess, the number of images attached to each email (image) poses even more of a challenge. Run the following code at the console to get a sense of its distribution:

table(email$image)
Recall that this tabulates the number of cases in each category (so there were 3811 emails with 0 images, for example). Given the very low counts at the higher number of images, let's collapse image into a categorical variable that indicates whether or not the email had at least one image. In this exercise, you'll create this new variable and explore its association with spam.





Starting with email, form a continuous chain that links together the following tasks:

Create a new variable called has_image that is TRUE where the number of images is greater than zero and FALSE otherwise.
Create an appropriate plot with email to visualize the relationship between has_image and spam.



# Create plot of proportion of spam by image
email %>%
  mutate(has_image = image > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = has_image, fill = spam)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")












Image and spam interpretation
Which of the following interpretations of the plot is valid?

An email without an image is more likely to be not-spam than spam.
