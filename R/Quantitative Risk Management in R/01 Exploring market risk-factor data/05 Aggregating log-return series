Aggregating log-return series
In statistics, aggregate data are data combined from several measurements. You just learned that you can compute compute weekly, monthly and quarterly log-returns by summing daily log-returns with the corresponding apply.weekly(), apply.monthly() and apply.quarterly() functions.

For example, you can use the following code to form the quarterly returns for a univariate time series data and multivariate time series mv_data:
> # apply.quarterly(x, FUN, ...)
> data_q = apply.quarterly(data, sum)
> mv_data_q = apply.quarterly(mv_data, colSums)

In this exercise, you will practice aggregating time series data using these functions and plotting the results. The data DJ and DJ_const are available in your workspace, as are the objects djx, which contains daily log-returns of the Dow Jones index from 2000-2015, and djreturns, which contains the daily log-returns for the first four DJ_const stocks from 2000-2015. Use plot for univariate time series and plot.zoo for multivariate time series.


Plot the object djx.
In one line, plot the weekly log-returns of djx with vertical bars.
Plot the monthly log-returns of djx with vertical bars.
Plot the object djreturns using plot.zoo.
Plot the monthly log-returns for djreturns with vertical bars using plot.zoo.




# Plot djx
plot(djx)

# Plot weekly log-returns of djx
plot(apply.weekly(djx, sum), type="h")

# Plot monthly log-returns of djx
plot(apply.monthly(djx, sum), type="h")


# Plot djreturns
plot.zoo(djreturns)

# Plot monthly log-returns of djreturns
plot.zoo(apply.monthly(djreturns, colSums), type="h")

These aggregation functions are extremely useful for analyzing risk over longer time horizons.


















A test on aggregation of log-returns
Data scientists often use the aggregations that you have learned so far in combination with summary statistics to extract even more insights from data. Functions that calculate summary statistics include mean(), median(), and var().

The object sp contains daily log-returns for the S&P 500 index for the period 1960-2015; it is loaded in your workspace. To three decimal places, what is the average quarterly log-return for the S&P 500 from 1990-2010?

> mean(apply.quarterly(sp["1990/2010"], sum))
[1] 0.01511181
