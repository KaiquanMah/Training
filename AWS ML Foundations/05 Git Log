Scenario #2
Let's walk through the git commands that go along with each step in the scenario you just observed in the video above.

Step 1: You check your commit history, seeing messages of the changes you made and how well it performed.
View log history
git log



Step 2: The model at this commit seemed to score the highest, so you decide to take a look.
Checkout a commit
git checkout bc90f2cbc9dc4e802b46e7a153aa106dc9a88560

After inspecting your code, you realize what modifications made this perform well, and use those for your model.




Step 3: Now, youâ€™re pretty confident merging this back into the development branch, and pushing the updated recommendation engine.
Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop

Merge friend_groups branch to develop
git merge --no-ff friend_groups

Push changes to remote repository
git push origin develop
