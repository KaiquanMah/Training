### TODO:
#    - insantiate a shirt object with the following characteristics:
#        - color red, size S, style long-sleeve, and price 25
#    - store the object in a variable called shirt_one
#
shirt_one = Shirt('red', 'S', 'long-sleeve', 25)
###








### TODO:
#     - print the price of the shirt using the price attribute
#     - use the change_price method to change the price of the shirt to 10
#     - print the price of the shirt using the price attribute
#     - use the discount method to print the price of the shirt with a 12% discount
#
print('Original price is :', shirt_one.price)

shirt_one.change_price(10)
print('New price is :', shirt_one.price)

print('New price is :', shirt_one.discount(.12))
###


Original price is : 25
New price is : 10
New price is : 8.8






### TODO:
#
#    - instantiate another object with the following characteristics:
# .       - color orange, size L, style short-sleeve, and price 10
#    - store the object in a variable called shirt_two
#
shirt_two = Shirt('orange', 'L', 'short-sleeve', 10)
###








### TODO:
#
#    - calculate the total cost of shirt_one and shirt_two
#    - store the results in a variable called total
#    
total = shirt_one.price+ shirt_two.price
print('Total price is :', total)
###


Total price is : 20




### TODO:
#
#    - use the shirt discount method to calculate the total cost if
#       shirt_one has a discount of 14% and shirt_two has a discount
#       of 6%
#    - store the results in a variable called total_discount
#
total_discount = shirt_one.discount(.14) + shirt_two.discount(.06)
print('New price is :', total_discount)
###

New price is : 18.0













#Test your Code
The following code cell tests your code.
There is a file called tests.py containing a function called run_tests(). The run_tests() function executes a handful of assert statements to check your work. You can see this file if you go to the Jupyter Notebook menu and click on "File->Open" and then open the tests.py file.
Execute the next code cell. The code will produce an error if your answers in this exercise are not what was expected. Keep working on your code until all tests are passing.
If you run the code cell and there is no output, then you passed all the tests!
As mentioned previously, there's also a file with a solution. To find the solution, click on the Jupyter logo at the top of the workspace, and then enter the folder titled 1.OOP_syntax_shirt_practice
