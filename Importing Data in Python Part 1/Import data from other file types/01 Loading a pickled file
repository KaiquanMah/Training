# There are a number of datatypes that cannot be saved easily to flat files, such as lists and dictionaries. If you want your files to be human readable, you may want to save them as text files in a clever manner.
# JSONs are appropriate for Python dictionaries.

# However, if you merely want to be able to import them into Python, you can serialize them. All this means is converting the object into a sequence of bytes, or a bytestream.

# Import pickle package
import pickle

# Open pickle file and load data using the variable that is bound to 'open': d
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    d = pickle.load(file)

# Print d
print(d)

# Print datatype of d
print(type(d))
