# If dtype=None, np.genfromtxt() will figure out what data types each column should be.

# import file
# names=True shows you are mindful that there is a header
data = np.genfromtxt('titanic.csv', delimiter=',', names=True, dtype=None)

# data = object = structured array (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html)
# Because numpy arrays have to contain elements that are all the same type, the structured array solves issues with importing data with multiple data types by being a 1D array, where each element of the array is a row of the flat file imported.
# You can test this by checking out the array's shape in the shell by executing np.shape(data).
# np.shape(data)
# (891,)

# Accessing rows and columns of structured arrays is super-intuitive: to get the ith row, merely execute data[i].
# To get the column with name 'Fare', execute data['Fare'].
