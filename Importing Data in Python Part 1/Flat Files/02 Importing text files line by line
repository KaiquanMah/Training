# For large files, we may not want to print all of their content to the shell: you may wish to print only the first few lines. Enter the readline() method, which allows you to do this.
# When a file called 'file' is open, you can print out the first line by executing file.readline().
# If you execute the same command again, the second line will print, and so on.

# context manager
# you can bind a variable file by using a context manager construct
# with open('huck_finn.txt') as file:

# While still within this construct, the variable 'file' will be bound to open('huck_finn.txt'); 
# thus, to print the file to the shell, all the code you need to execute is:
# with open('huck_finn.txt') as file:
#    print(file.readline())

# Read & print the first 3 lines
with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
