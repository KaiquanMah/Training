# When melting DataFrames, it would be better to have column names more meaningful than variable and value (the default names used by pd.melt()).
# The default names may work in certain situations, but it's best to always have data that is self explanatory.
# You can rename the variable column by specifying an argument to the var_name parameter, and the value column by specifying an argument to the value_name parameter. You will now practice doing exactly this. Pandas as pd and the DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded for you.


# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

# Melt airquality: airquality_melt
airquality_melt = pd.melt(airquality, id_vars=['Month', 'Day'], 
                        var_name='measurement', 
                        value_name='reading')

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())
