# So far, you've used the .pivot_table() method when there are multiple index values you want to hold constant during a pivot. In the video, Dan showed you how you can also use pivot tables to deal with duplicate values by providing an aggregation function through the aggfunc parameter. Here, you're going to combine both these uses of pivot tables.
# Let's say your data collection method accidentally duplicated your dataset. Such a dataset, in which each row is duplicated, has been pre-loaded as airquality_dup. In addition, the airquality_melt DataFrame from the previous exercise has been pre-loaded. Explore their shapes in the IPython Shell by accessing their .shape attributes to confirm the duplicate rows present in airquality_dup.
# You'll see that by using .pivot_table() and the aggfunc parameter, you can not only reshape your data, but also remove duplicates. Finally, you can then flatten the columns of the pivoted DataFrame using .reset_index().
# NumPy and pandas have been imported as np and pd respectively.

# The default aggregation function used by .pivot_table() is np.mean(). So you could have pivoted the duplicate values in this DataFrame even without explicitly specifying the aggfunc parameter.

# Pivot table the airquality_dup: airquality_pivot
airquality_pivot = airquality_dup.pivot_table(index=['Month', 'Day'], columns='measurement', values='reading', aggfunc=np.mean)

# Print the head of airquality_pivot before reset_index
print(airquality_pivot.head())

# Reset the index of airquality_pivot
airquality_pivot = airquality_pivot.reset_index()

# Print the head of airquality_pivot
print(airquality_pivot.head())

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())
