# Now that you have a list of filenames to load, you can load all the files into a list of DataFrames that can then be concatenated.
# You'll start with an empty list called frames. Your job is to use a for loop to:
# 1. iterate through each of the filenames
# 2. read each filename into a DataFrame, and then
# 3. append it to the frames list.
# You can then concatenate this list of DataFrames using pd.concat(). Go for it!


# Create an empty list: frames
frames = []

#  Iterate over csv_files
for csv in csv_files:

    #  Read csv into a DataFrame: df
    df = pd.read_csv(csv)
    
    # Append df to frames
    frames.append(df)

# At this point, frames = a list
# frames[index #] = a DataFrame, one for each file we iterated over
# Now we want to concatenate all the DataFrames we have into a single DataFrame: uber
uber = pd.concat(frames)

# Print the shape of uber
print(uber.shape)

# Print the head of uber
print(uber.head())
