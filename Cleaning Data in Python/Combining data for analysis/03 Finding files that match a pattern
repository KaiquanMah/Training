# You're now going to practice using the glob module to find all csv files in the workspace. In the next exercise, you'll programmatically load them into DataFrames.
# As Dan showed you in the video, the glob module has a function called glob that takes a pattern and returns a list of the files in the working directory that match that pattern.
# For example, if you know the pattern is part_ single digit number .csv, you can write the pattern as 'part_?.csv' (which would match part_1.csv, part_2.csv, part_3.csv, etc.)
# Similarly, you can find all .csv files with '*.csv', or all parts with 'part_*'. The ? wildcard represents any 1 character, and the * wildcard represents any number of characters.


# Import necessary modules
import glob
import pandas as pd

# Write the pattern: pattern
pattern = '*.csv'

# Save all file matches into a list: csv_files
csv_files = glob.glob(pattern)

# Print the list of file names
print(csv_files)

# Load the second file from the list into a DataFrame: csv2
csv2 = pd.read_csv(csv_files[1])

# Print the head of csv2
print(csv2.head())
