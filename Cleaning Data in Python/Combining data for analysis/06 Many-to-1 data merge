# In a many-to-one (or one-to-many) merge, one of the values will be duplicated and recycled in the output. That is, one of the keys in the merge is not unique.
# Here, the two DataFrames site and visited have been pre-loaded once again. Note that this time, visited has multiple entries for the site column. Confirm this by exploring it in the IPython Shell.
# The .merge() method call is the same as the 1-to-1 merge from the previous exercise, but the data and output will be different.


# Merge the DataFrames: m2o
m2o = pd.merge(left=site, right=visited, left_on='name', right_on='site')

# Print m2o
print(m2o)
