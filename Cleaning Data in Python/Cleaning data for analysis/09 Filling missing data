# Here, you'll return to the airquality dataset from Chapter 2. It has been pre-loaded into the DataFrame airquality, and it has missing values for you to practice filling in. Explore airquality in the IPython Shell to checkout which columns have missing values.
# It's rare to have a (real-world) dataset without any missing values, and it's important to deal with them because certain calculations cannot handle missing values while some calculations will, by default, skip over any missing values.
# Also, understanding how much missing data you have, and thinking about where it comes from is crucial to making unbiased interpretations of data.


# Calculate the mean of the Ozone column: oz_mean
oz_mean = airquality.Ozone.mean()

# Replace all the missing values in the Ozone column with the mean
airquality['Ozone'] = airquality.Ozone.fillna(oz_mean)

# Print the info of airquality
print(airquality.info())
