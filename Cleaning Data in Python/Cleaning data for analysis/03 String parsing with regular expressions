# In the video, Dan introduced you to the basics of regular expressions, which are powerful ways of defining patterns to match strings. This exercise will get you started with writing them.
# When working with data, it is sometimes necessary to write a regular expression to look for properly entered values. Phone numbers in a dataset is a common field that needs to be checked for validity. Your job in this exercise is to define a regular expression to match US phone numbers that fit the pattern of xxx-xxx-xxxx.
# The regular expression module in python is re. When performing pattern matching on data, since the pattern will be used for a match across multiple rows, it's better to compile the pattern first using re.compile(), and then use the compiled pattern to match values.
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html


# Import the regular expression module
import re

# Compile the pattern: prog
prog = re.compile('\d{3}\-\d{3}\-\d{4}')

# See if the pattern matches
result = prog.match('123-456-7890')
print(bool(result))

# See if the pattern matches
result2 = prog.match('1123-456-7890')
print(bool(result2))
