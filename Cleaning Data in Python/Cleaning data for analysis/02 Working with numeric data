# If you expect the data type of a column to be numeric (int or float), but instead it is of type object, this typically means that there is a non numeric value in the column, which also signifies bad data.
# You can use the pd.to_numeric() function to convert a column into a numeric data type. If the function raises an error, you can be sure that there is a bad value within the column. You can either use the techniques you learned in Chapter 1 to do some exploratory data analysis and find the bad value, or you can choose to ignore or coerce the value into a missing value, NaN.
# A modified version of the tips dataset has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called tips. For instructional purposes, it has been pre-processed to introduce some 'bad' data for you to clean. Use the .info() method to explore this. You'll note that the total_bill and tip columns, which should be numeric, are instead of type object. Your job is to fix this.


# Convert 'total_bill' to a numeric dtype
tips['total_bill'] = pd.to_numeric(tips['total_bill'], errors='coerce')

# Convert 'tip' to a numeric dtype
tips['tip'] = pd.to_numeric(tips.tip, errors='coerce')

# Print the info of tips
print(tips.info())
