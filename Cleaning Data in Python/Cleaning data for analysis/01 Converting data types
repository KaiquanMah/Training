# In this exercise, you'll see how ensuring all categorical variables in a DataFrame are of type category reduces memory usage.
# The tips dataset has been loaded into a DataFrame called tips. This data contains information about how much a customer tipped, whether the customer was male or female, a smoker or not, etc.
# Look at the output of tips.info() in the IPython Shell. You'll note that two columns that should be categorical - sex and smoker - are instead of type object, which is pandas' way of storing arbitrary strings. Your job is to convert these two columns to type category and note the reduced memory usage.
# dataset: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/tips.csv


# Convert the sex column to type 'category'
tips.sex = tips.sex.astype('category')

# Convert the smoker column to type 'category'
tips.smoker = tips.smoker.astype('category')

# Print the info of tips
print(tips.info())
