# Now that your data are in the proper shape, you need to ensure that the columns are of the proper data type. That is, you need to ensure that country is of type object, year is of type int64, and life_expectancy is of type float64.
# The tidy DataFrame has been pre-loaded as gapminder. Explore it in the IPython Shell using the .info() method. Notice that the column 'year' is of type object. This is incorrect, so you'll need to use the pd.to_numeric() function to convert it to a numeric data type.
# NumPy and pandas have been pre-imported as np and pd.


# Convert the year column to numeric
gapminder.year = pd.to_numeric(gapminder.year)

# Test if country is of type object
assert gapminder.country.dtypes == np.object

# Test if year is of type int64
assert gapminder.year.dtypes == np.int64

# Test if life_expectancy is of type float64
assert gapminder.life_expectancy.dtypes == np.float64
