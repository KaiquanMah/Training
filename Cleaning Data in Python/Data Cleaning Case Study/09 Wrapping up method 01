# Now that you have a clean and tidy dataset, you can do a bit of visualization and aggregation. In this exercise, you'll begin by creating a histogram of the life_expectancy column. You should not get any values under 0 and you should see something reasonable on the higher end of the life_expectancy age range.
# Your next task is to investigate how average life expectancy changed over the years. To do this, you need to subset the data by each year, get the life_expectancy column from each subset, and take an average of the values. You can achieve this using the .groupby() method. This .groupby() method is covered in greater depth in Manipulating DataFrames with pandas.
# Finally, you can save your tidy and summarized DataFrame to a file using the .to_csv() method.
# matplotlib.pyplot and pandas have been pre-imported as plt and pd. Go for it!

# Create a histogram of the life_expectancy column using the .plot() method of gapminder. Specify kind='hist'.
# Group gapminder by 'year' and aggregate 'life_expectancy' by the mean. To do this:
  # Use the .groupby() method on gapminder with 'year' as the argument. Then select 'life_expectancy' and chain the .mean() method to it.
# Print the head and tail of gapminder_agg. This has been done for you.
# Create a line plot of average life expectancy per year by using the .plot() method (without any arguments in plot) on gapminder_agg.
# Save gapminder and gapminder_agg to csv files called 'gapminder.csv' and 'gapminder_agg.csv', respectively, using the .to_csv() method.



# Add first subplot
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1) 

# Create a histogram of life_expectancy
gapminder.plot(kind='hist', y='life_expectancy')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Group gapminder: gapminder_agg
# for each year, give me the average life_expectancy
gapminder_agg = gapminder.groupby('year')['life_expectancy'].mean()

# Print the head of gapminder_agg
print(gapminder_agg.head())

# Print the tail of gapminder_agg
print(gapminder_agg.tail())

# Add second subplot
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)

# Create a line plot of life expectancy per year
gapminder_agg.plot()

# Add title and specify axis labels
plt.title('Life expectancy over the years')
plt.ylabel('Life expectancy')
plt.xlabel('Year')

# Display the plots
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Save both DataFrames to csv files
gapminder.to_csv()
gapminder_agg.to_csv()
