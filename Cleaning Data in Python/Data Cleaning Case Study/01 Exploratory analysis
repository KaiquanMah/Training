# Whenever you obtain a new dataset, your first task should always be to do some exploratory analysis to get a better understanding of the data and diagnose it for any potential issues.
# The Gapminder data for the 19th century has been loaded into a DataFrame called g1800s. In the IPython Shell, use pandas methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe(), and DataFrame attributes like .columns and .shape to explore it.
# Use the information that you acquire from your exploratory analysis to choose the true statement from the options provided below.
