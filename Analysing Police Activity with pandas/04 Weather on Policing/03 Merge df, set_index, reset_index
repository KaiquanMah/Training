Preparing the DataFrames
In this exercise, you'll prepare the traffic stop and weather rating DataFrames so that they're ready to be merged:
With the ri DataFrame, you'll move the stop_datetime index to a column since the index will be lost during the merge.
With the weather DataFrame, you'll select the DATE and rating columns and put them in a new DataFrame.

Reset the index of the ri DataFrame.
Examine the head of ri to verify that stop_datetime is now a DataFrame column, and the index is now the default integer index.
Create a new DataFrame named weather_rating that contains only the DATE and rating columns from the weather DataFrame.
Examine the head of weather_rating to verify that it contains the proper columns.

# Reset the index of 'ri'
ri.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Examine the head of 'ri'
print(ri.head())

Great work! The ri and weather_rating DataFrames are now ready to be merged.















Merging the DataFrames
In this exercise, you'll merge the ri and weather_rating DataFrames into a new DataFrame, ri_weather.
The DataFrames will be joined using the stop_date column from ri and the DATE column from weather_rating. Thankfully the date formatting matches exactly, which is not always the case!
Once the merge is complete, you'll set stop_datetime as the index, which is the column you saved in the previous exercise.

Examine the shape of the ri DataFrame.
Merge the ri and weather_rating DataFrames using a left join.
Examine the shape of ri_weather to confirm that it has two more columns but the same number of rows as ri.
Replace the index of ri_weather with the stop_datetime column.

# Examine the shape of 'ri'
print(ri.shape)

# Merge 'ri' and 'weather_rating' using a left join
ri_weather = pd.merge(left=ri, right=weather_rating, left_on='stop_date', right_on='DATE', how='left')

# Examine the shape of 'ri_weather'
print(ri_weather.shape)

# Set 'stop_datetime' as the index of 'ri_weather'
ri_weather.set_index('stop_datetime', inplace=True)

<script.py> output:
    (86536, 16)
    (86536, 18)
    
Fantastic! In the next section, you'll use ri_weather to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and police behavior.
