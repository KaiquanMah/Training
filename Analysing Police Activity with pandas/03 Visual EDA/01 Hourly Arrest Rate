Calculating the hourly arrest rate
When a police officer stops a driver, a small percentage of those stops ends in an arrest. This is known as the arrest rate. In this exercise, you'll find out whether the arrest rate varies by time of day.
First, you'll calculate the arrest rate across all stops. Then, you'll calculate the hourly arrest rate by using the hour attribute of the index. The hour ranges from 0 to 23, in which:
0 = midnight
12 = noon
23 = 11 PM

Take the mean of the is_arrested column to calculate the overall arrest rate.
Group by the hour attribute of the DataFrame index to calculate the hourly arrest rate.
Save the hourly arrest rate Series as a new object, hourly_arrest_rate.
# Calculate the overall arrest rate
print(ri.is_arrested.mean())
<script.py> output:
    0.0355690117407784






# Calculate the hourly arrest rate
print(ri.groupby(ri.index.hour).is_arrested.mean())
<script.py> output:

# Save the hourly arrest rate
hourly_arrest_rate = ri.groupby(ri.index.hour).is_arrested.mean()








Plotting the hourly arrest rate
In this exercise, you'll create a line plot from the hourly_arrest_rate object. A line plot is appropriate in this case because you're showing how a quantity changes over time.
This plot should help you to spot some trends that may not have been obvious when examining the raw numbers!

Import matplotlib.pyplot using the alias plt.
Create a line plot of hourly_arrest_rate using the .plot() method.
Label the x-axis as 'Hour', label the y-axis as 'Arrest Rate', and title the plot 'Arrest Rate by Time of Day'.
Display the plot using the .show() function.
# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a line plot of 'hourly_arrest_rate'
hourly_arrest_rate.plot()

# Add the xlabel, ylabel, and title
plt.xlabel('Hour')
plt.ylabel('Arrest Rate')
plt.title('Arrest Rate by Time of Day')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
Wow! The arrest rate has a significant spike overnight, and then dips in the early morning hours.
