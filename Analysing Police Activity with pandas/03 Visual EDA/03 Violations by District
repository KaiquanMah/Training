Tallying violations by district
The state of Rhode Island is broken into six police districts, also known as zones. How do the zones compare in terms of what violations are caught by police?
In this exercise, you'll create a frequency table to determine how many violations of each type took place in each of the six zones. Then, you'll filter the table to focus on the "K" zones, which you'll examine further in the next exercise.

Create a frequency table from the district and violation columns using the pd.crosstab() function.
Save the frequency table as a new object, all_zones.
Select rows 'Zone K1' through 'Zone K3' from all_zones using the .loc[] accessor.
Save the smaller table as a new object, k_zones.

Great job! Next you'll plot the violations so that you can compare these districts.

















Plotting violations by district
Now that you've created a frequency table focused on the "K" zones, you'll visualize the data to help you compare what violations are being caught in each zone.
First you'll create a bar plot, which is an appropriate plot type since you're comparing categorical data. Then you'll create a stacked bar plot in order to get a slightly different look at the data. Which plot do you find to be more insightful?

Create a bar plot of k_zones.
Display the plot and examine it. What do you notice about each of the zones?
# Create a bar plot of 'k_zones'
k_zones.plot(kind='bar')

# Display the plot
plt.show()



Create a stacked bar plot of k_zones.
Display the plot and examine it. Do you notice anything different about the data than you did previously?
# Create a stacked bar plot of 'k_zones'
k_zones.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)


# Display the plot
plt.show()
Interesting! The vast majority of traffic stops in Zone K1 are for speeding, and Zones K2 and K3 are remarkably similar to one another in terms of violations.
