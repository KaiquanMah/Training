Counting protective frisks
During a vehicle search, the police officer may pat down the driver to check if they have a weapon. This is known as a "protective frisk."
In this exercise, you'll first check to see how many times "Protective Frisk" was the only search type. Then, you'll use a string method to locate all instances in which the driver was frisked.

Count the search_type values to see how many times "Protective Frisk" was the only search type.
Create a new column, frisk, that is True if search_type contains the string "Protective Frisk" and False otherwise.
Check the data type of frisk to confirm that it's a Boolean Series.
Take the sum of frisk to count the total number of frisks.
# Count the 'search_type' values
print(ri.search_type.value_counts())

# Check if 'search_type' contains the string 'Protective Frisk'
ri['frisk'] = ri.search_type.str.contains('Protective Frisk', na=False)

Nice job! It looks like there were 303 drivers who were frisked. Next, you'll examine whether gender affects who is frisked.



















Comparing frisk rates by gender
In this exercise, you'll compare the rates at which female and male drivers are frisked during a search. Are males frisked more often than females, perhaps because police officers consider them to be higher risk?
Before doing any calculations, it's important to filter the DataFrame to only include the relevant subset of data, namely stops in which a search was conducted.

Create a DataFrame, searched, that only contains rows in which search_conducted is True.
Take the mean of the frisk column to find out what percentage of searches included a frisk.
Calculate the frisk rate for each gender using a .groupby().
# Create a DataFrame of stops in which a search was conducted
searched = ri[ri.search_conducted == True]


# Calculate the overall frisk rate by taking the mean of 'frisk'
print(searched.frisk.mean())
<script.py> output:
    0.09162382824312065
    
# Calculate the frisk rate for each gender
print(searched.groupby('driver_gender').frisk.mean())
<script.py> output:
    driver_gender
    F    0.074561
    M    0.094353
    Name: frisk, dtype: float64

Interesting! The frisk rate is higher for males than for females, though we can't conclude that this difference is caused by the driver's gender.
