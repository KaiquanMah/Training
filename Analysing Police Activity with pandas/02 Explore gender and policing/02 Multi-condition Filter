Filtering by multiple conditions
Which one of these commands would filter the ri DataFrame to only include female drivers who were stopped for a speeding violation?

ri[(ri.driver_gender = 'F') & (ri.violation = 'Speeding')]
ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F' & ri.violation == 'Speeding']
ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') | (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]
ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') and (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]

#yes ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') & (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]
Correct! We'll use this code to filter the DataFrame in the next exercise.










Comparing speeding outcomes by gender
When a driver is pulled over for speeding, many people believe that gender has an impact on whether the driver will receive a ticket or a warning. Can you find evidence of this in the dataset?
First, you'll create two DataFrames of drivers who were stopped for speeding: one containing females and the other containing males.
Then, for each gender, you'll use the stop_outcome column to calculate what percentage of stops resulted in a "Citation" (meaning a ticket) versus a "Warning".

Create a DataFrame, female_and_speeding, that only includes female drivers who were stopped for speeding.
Create a DataFrame, male_and_speeding, that only includes male drivers who were stopped for speeding.
Count the stop outcomes for the female drivers and express them as proportions.
Count the stop outcomes for the male drivers and express them as proportions.

# Create a DataFrame of female drivers stopped for speeding
female_and_speeding = ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') & (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]

# Create a DataFrame of male drivers stopped for speeding
male_and_speeding = ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'M') & (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]

# Compute the stop outcomes for female drivers (as proportions)
print(female_and_speeding.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize=True))
<script.py> output:
    Citation            0.952192
    Warning             0.040074
    Arrest Driver       0.005752
    N/D                 0.000959
    Arrest Passenger    0.000639
    No Action           0.000383
    Name: stop_outcome, dtype: float64


# Compute the stop outcomes for male drivers (as proportions)
print(male_and_speeding.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize=True))
<script.py> output:
    Citation            0.944595
    Warning             0.036184
    Arrest Driver       0.015895
    Arrest Passenger    0.001281
    No Action           0.001068
    N/D                 0.000976
    Name: stop_outcome, dtype: float64

Interesting! The numbers are similar for males and females: about 95% of stops for speeding result in a ticket. Thus, the data fails to show that gender has an impact on who gets a ticket for speeding.
