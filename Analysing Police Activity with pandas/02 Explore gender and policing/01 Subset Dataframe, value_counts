Examining traffic violations
Before comparing the violations being committed by each gender, you should examine the violations committed by all drivers to get a baseline understanding of the data.
In this exercise, you'll count the unique values in the violation column, and then separately express those counts as proportions.

Count the unique values in the violation column of the ri DataFrame, to see what violations are being committed by all drivers.
Express the violation counts as proportions of the total.
# Count the unique values in 'violation'
print(ri.violation.value_counts())


<script.py> output:
    Speeding               48423
    Moving violation       16224
    Equipment              10921
    Other                   4409
    Registration/plates     3703
    Seat belt               2856
    Name: violation, dtype: int64

    
# Express the counts as proportions
print(ri.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))
<script.py> output:
    Speeding               0.559571
    Moving violation       0.187483
    Equipment              0.126202
    Other                  0.050950
    Registration/plates    0.042791
    Seat belt              0.033004
    Name: violation, dtype: float64

Interesting! More than half of all violations are for speeding, followed by other moving violations and equipment violations.








Comparing violations by gender
The question we're trying to answer is whether male and female drivers tend to commit different types of traffic violations.
In this exercise, you'll first create a DataFrame for each gender, and then analyze the violations in each DataFrame separately.

Create a DataFrame, female, that only contains rows in which driver_gender is 'F'.
Create a DataFrame, male, that only contains rows in which driver_gender is 'M'.
Count the violations committed by female drivers and express them as proportions.
Count the violations committed by male drivers and express them as proportions.

# Create a DataFrame of female drivers
female = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F']

# Create a DataFrame of male drivers
male = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'M']

# Compute the violations by female drivers (as proportions)
print(female.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))
<script.py> output:
    Speeding               0.658114
    Moving violation       0.138218
    Equipment              0.105199
    Registration/plates    0.044418
    Other                  0.029738
    Seat belt              0.024312
    Name: violation, dtype: float64


# Compute the violations by male drivers (as proportions)
print(male.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))
<script.py> output:
    Speeding               0.522243
    Moving violation       0.206144
    Equipment              0.134158
    Other                  0.058985
    Registration/plates    0.042175
    Seat belt              0.036296
    Name: violation, dtype: float64
