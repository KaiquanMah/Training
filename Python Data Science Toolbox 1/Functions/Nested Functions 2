# Closure
# The nested or inner function remembers the state of its enclosing scope when called.
# Thus, anything defined locally in the enclosing scope is available to the inner function even when the outer function has finished execution.

# Define echo
def echo(n):
    """Return the inner_echo function."""

    # Define inner_echo
    def inner_echo(word1):
        """Concatenate n copies of word1."""
        echo_word = word1 * n
        return echo_word

    # Return inner_echo
    return(inner_echo)

# Call echo: twice
twice = echo(2)

# Call echo: thrice
thrice = echo(3)

# Call twice() and thrice() then print
print(twice('hello'), thrice('hello'))
