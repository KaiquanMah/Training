1. FizzBuzz 
Given a number n, for each integer i in the range from 1 to n inclusive, print one value per line as follows: 
• If i is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz. 
If i is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), print Fizz. 
If i is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), print Buzz. 
• If i is not a multiple of 3 or 5, print the value of i.

Explanation 
The numbers 3, 6, 9, and 12 are multiples of 3 (but not 5), so print Fizz on those lines. 
The numbers 5 and 10 are multiples of 5 (but not 3), so print Buzz on those lines. 
The number 15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5, so print FizzBuzz on that line. 
None of the other values is a multiple of either 3 or 5, so print the value of i on those lines.
