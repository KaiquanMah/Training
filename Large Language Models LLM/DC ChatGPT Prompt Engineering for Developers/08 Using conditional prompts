Using conditional prompts
Building upon the previous task, your next challenge is to enhance the responses you received. When processing a given text, you need to determine its language, count the number of sentences, and generate a suitable title if the text contains more than one sentence. However, here's the new twist: if the text consists of only one sentence, no title should be generated, and instead, the model should display "N/A". This modification ensures that the title is generated only for texts with multiple sentences, providing a more refined and practical output for your platform's users.
The OpenAI package, the get_response() function, and the sample text have been pre-loaded for you.



Create the instructions, with the directions to infer the language and the number of sentences of the given delimited text; then if the text contains more than one sentence, generate a suitable title for it, otherwise, write 'N/A' for the title.
Create the output_format, with directions to include the text, language, number of sentences, and title, each on a separate line,and ensure to use 'Text:', 'Language:', and 'Title:' as prefixes for each line.




client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Create the instructions
instructions = f"infer language, number of sentences of given text delimited by triple backticks. if text contains more than 1 sentence, generate subtitle for it. else, write 'N/A' for title ```{text}```"

# Create the output format
output_format = '''Text:
                   Language:
                   Title:
                '''

prompt = instructions + output_format + f"```{text}```"
response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)


    Language: English  
    Title: A Golden Sunset
