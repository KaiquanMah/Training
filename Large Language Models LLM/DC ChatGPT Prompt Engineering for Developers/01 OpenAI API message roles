OpenAI API message roles
You are developing a chatbot for an event management agency that will be used to facilitate networking during events.
Using the OpenAI API, you prepare a dictionary to pass as the message to the chat.completions endpoint. The message needs to have 3 roles defined to ensure the model has enough guidance to provide helpful responses.
Throughout the course, you'll write Python code to interact with the OpenAI API. Entering your own API key is not necessary to create requests and complete the exercises in this course. You can leave the placeholder "<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>" as the key in api_key.
The OpenAI package has been pre-loaded for you.



Create an OpenAI API Python client; setting your personal key is not required, you can leave the placeholder.
Complete the dictionary of messages with the role corresponding to each of the messages provided.


==================

# Create the OpenAI client: you can leave "<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>" as is
'''
There was an error in your code
The error comes from the following part of the code:

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")
What is the issue?

The error message indicates that the API key provided is incorrect. In your code, you are trying to create an instance of the OpenAI class from the openai module, but it seems that the API key placeholder <OPENAI_API_TOKEN> is not being recognized as a valid key. This could be due to the way you are importing and using the OpenAI class.

How do you fix it?

To resolve this issue, you should use the OpenAI class that you defined in your code instead of the one from the openai module. Here’s how you can fix that line:

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")
This change will ensure that you are using your custom OpenAI class, which is correctly set up with the necessary configurations.
'''
# import openai
# client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")
client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Define the conversation messages
conversation_messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful event management assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are some good conversation starters at networking events?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=conversation_messages
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)

    Here are some effective conversation starters you can use at networking events:
    
    1. **Personal Connection**:
       - "What brought you to this event today?"
       - "Have you attended this event before? What was your experience like?"
    
    2. **Current Trends**:
       - "What trends are you seeing in our industry right now?"
       - "How do you think [specific trend or technology] will impact our field in the next few years?"

       - "Can you recommend a book or podcast that has influenced your career?"
       - "What’s the best piece of career advice you’ve ever received?"
    
    6. **Event Feedback**:
       - "What do you think about the speaker/panel discussion we just heard?"
       - "Have you found any valuable connections here so far?"
    
    7. **Personal Interests**:
       - "Outside of work, what hobbies or activities do you enjoy?"

        - "What’s a fun fact about yourself that most people don’t know?"
    
    Using these conversation starters can help you break the ice and engage in meaningful discussions with other attendees. Remember to listen actively and ask follow-up questions to deepen the conversation!
