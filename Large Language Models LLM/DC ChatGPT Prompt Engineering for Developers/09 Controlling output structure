Controlling output structure
One way to control the output structure provided by a language model is to give it a sample question-answer in the prompt. The model will learn from it and follow it when generating responses for similar questions. This exercise aims to let you build a one-shot prompt that extracts odd numbers from a given set of numbers and displays them as a set of numbers between brackets, separated by commas as shown in the instructions.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.


Create a one-shot prompt that provides an example showing how to extract the odd numbers from the set {1, 3, 7, 12, 19}, and seeks an answer for the set {3, 5, 11, 12, 16}.


client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Create a one-shot prompt
prompt = """Q: extract odd numbers from {1, 3, 7, 12, 19}.
            A: {1,3,7,19}
            Q: extract odd numbers from {3, 5, 11, 12, 16}.
            A: """

response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)
    {3, 5, 11}
