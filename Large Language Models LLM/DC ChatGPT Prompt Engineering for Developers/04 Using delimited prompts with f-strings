Using delimited prompts with f-strings
You are a junior developer at a dynamic startup that generates content with the help of AI. The company believes this technology can revolutionize storytelling, and you are excited to be a part of it. Today, your task is to generate a continuation of a story with a delimited prompt using an f-string.
The OpenAI package, the get_response() function, and the story variable have been pre-loaded for you.


Create a prompt asking to complete the variable story (provided to you as a string): use f-string, and delimit the story with triple backticks (```) to pass its content to the prompt.
Get the generated response.

# Get the generated response 
response = get_response(prompt)

print("\n Original story: \n", story)

One fateful day, while exploring an uncharted asteroid belt, Alex stumbled upon a peculiar object that would change the course of their interstellar journey forever...
    
    As Alex approached the object, a shimmering orb pulsating with vibrant colors, they felt an inexplicable pull. The orb was unlike anything they had ever seen—smooth and warm to the touch, it seemed to hum with energy. Curiosity piqued, Alex reached out and placed their hand on its surface. Instantly, a surge of light enveloped them, and the asteroid belt faded away, replaced by a swirling vortex of stars and galaxies.
    
    When the light subsided, Alex found themselves aboard a massive, ancient spacecraft, its corridors lined with intricate carvings that told stories



error:
Double check your prompt is asking to complete the story and specifies the correct delimeters (triple backticks) in the prompt.

    The object was a shimmering, crystalline sphere, pulsating with a soft, ethereal light. Intrigued, Alex maneuvered the ship closer, the asteroid belt swirling around like a cosmic dance. As the ship's sensors scanned the sphere, a series of strange symbols began to illuminate on its surface, each one glowing brighter than the last.
    
    Curiosity piqued, Alex decided to retrieve the sphere. With a deft maneuver, they extended the ship's robotic arm and gently grasped the object. The moment it was secured, a surge of energy coursed through the ship, causing the lights to flicker and the control panel to beep erratically. Alex's heart raced as they struggled to maintain control.
    
    Suddenly, the ship was enveloped in a blinding light, and when it faded, Alex found themselves in a completely different part of the galaxy. The stars looked unfamiliar,
