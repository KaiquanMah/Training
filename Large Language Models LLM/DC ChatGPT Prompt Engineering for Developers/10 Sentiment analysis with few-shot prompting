Sentiment analysis with few-shot prompting
You're working on market research and your goal is to use few-shot prompting to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews. You are assigning a number for a given customers conversation: -1 if the sentiment is negative, 1 if positive. You provide the following examples as previous conversations for the model to learn from.

The product quality exceeded my expectations -> 1
I had a terrible experience with this product's customer service -> -1
The OpenAI package has been pre-loaded for you.




Provide the examples as previous conversations assigning the text as context for the user role and the number as context for the assistant role.
Provide the following text for the model to classify and use the appropriate role: The price of the product is really fair given its features


client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model = "gpt-4o-mini",
  # Provide the examples as previous conversations
  messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "The product quality exceeded my expectations"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"},
