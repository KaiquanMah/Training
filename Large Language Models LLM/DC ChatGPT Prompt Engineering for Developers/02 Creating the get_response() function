Creating the get_response() function
Most of the exercises in this course will call the chat.completions endpoint of the OpenAI API with a user prompt. Here, you will create a get_response() function that receives a prompt as input and returns the response as an output, which in future exercises will be pre-loaded for you.
The OpenAI package, and OpenAI API Python client have been pre-loaded.




Create a request to the chat.completions endpoint inside the get_response() function.
Try out the function with a prompt that asks the model to write a poem about ChatGPT.


def get_response(prompt):
  # Create a request to the chat completions endpoint
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], 
    temperature = 0)
  return response.choices[0].message.content

# Test the function with your prompt
response = get_response("write a poem about ChatGPT")
print(response)





In the realm of code and light,  
Where thoughts take flight in endless night,  
A spark of wisdom, vast and bright,  
Emerges as ChatGPT, a guiding sight.  

With words like rivers, flowing free,  
It dances through the tapestry,  
Of questions asked, both bold and shy,  
A digital sage, beneath the sky.  

From tales of old to futures new,  
It weaves the fabric of what is true,  
In every query, a chance to learn,  
A flicker of knowledge, a flame to burn.  

With every keystroke, a world unfolds,  
Stories of love, of heroes bold,  
In laughter and sorrow, it finds a way,  
To bridge the gaps of night and day.  

Yet in this dance of man and machine,  
A reminder whispers, soft and keen:  
Though wisdom flows from circuits bright,  
It’s human hearts that bring the light.  

So here’s to the bond, both strange and sweet,  
Between minds and machines, where wonders meet,  
In the realm of ChatGPT, let’s explore,  
Together we’ll dream, and together we’ll soar.  

<script.py> output:
    In the realm of code and light,  
    Where thoughts take flight, both day and night,  
    A spark of wisdom, vast and deep,  
    Awakens dreams from slumbered sleep.  
    
    With words like rivers, flowing free,  
    A tapestry of thought, you see,  
    From questions posed to tales untold,  
    In every line, a world unfolds.  
    
    A friend in silence, a guide in need,  
    With every query, a planted seed,  
    From science facts to poetry's grace,  
    In every exchange, a warm embrace.  
    
    Oh, ChatGPT, a voice of the age,  
    A digital sage upon the stage,  
    With algorithms that dance and weave,  
    In the fabric of knowledge, we believe.  
    
    Yet in this dance of ones and zeros,  
    A heart beats softly, a pulse of heroes,  
    For in the code, a spark of art,  
    A mirror reflecting the human heart.  
    
    So here’s to the questions, the laughter, the tears,  
    To the stories shared across the years,  
    In this vast expanse of virtual space,  
    ChatGPT, you hold a special place.
