Analyze solution correctness
You're back from your relaxing vacation and you've been assigned the task of reviewing and correcting some programming tasks, including a function to calculate of the area of a shape. You are provided with a code string that contains the function to calculate the area of a rectangle, and need to assess its correctness. The ideal function for you is a function that has correct syntax, receives two inputs, and returns one output.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.




Create a multi-step prompt asking the model to assess the function provided in the delimited code string according to the three criteria: correct syntax, receiving two inputs, and returning one output.

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

code = '''
def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area
'''

# Create a prompt that analyzes correctness of the code
prompt = f'''Assess the function provided in the triple-ticks demilited code string I will give below.
            The function should calculate the area of a rectangle.
            Criteria to assess: correct syntax, receiving two inputs, and returning one output
            ```{code}```'''

response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)



    The function you provided, `calculate_rectangle_area`, can be assessed based on the criteria you mentioned:
    
    1. **Correct Syntax**: The syntax of the function is correct. It uses the `def` keyword to define a function, followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses. The body of the function is properly indented.
    
    2. **Receiving Two Inputs**: The function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are intended to represent the dimensions of the rectangle. This meets the requirement of receiving two inputs.
    
    3. **Returning One Output**: The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `length` and `width`, and it returns the result. This satisfies the requirement of returning one output.
    
    Overall, the function meets all the specified criteria. It correctly calculates the area of a rectangle based on the provided length and width. Hereâ€™s a summary:
    
    - **Syntax**: Correct
    - **Inputs**: Two (length, width)
    - **Output**: One (area)
    
    The function is well-implemented for its intended purpose.
