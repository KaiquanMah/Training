Code generation with problem description
You work as an analyst for a retail company and analyze monthly sales data. You need to develop a Python function that accepts a list of 12 numbers representing sales for each month of the year and outputs the month with the highest sales value. This information will help your company identify the most profitable month. You feed the problem description to a language model to get help.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.


Craft a prompt that asks the model to write a Python function that receives a list of 12 floats representing monthly sales data as input and, returns the month with the highest sales value as output.

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Craft a prompt that asks the model for the function
prompt = "Write Python function that receives a list of 12 floats representing monthly sales data as input and, returns the month with the highest sales value as output."

response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)


<script.py> output:
    You can create a Python function that takes a list of 12 floats representing monthly sales data and returns the month with the highest sales value. Here's a sample implementation:
    
    ```python
    def month_with_highest_sales(sales_data):
        if len(sales_data) != 12:
            raise ValueError("The sales data must contain exactly 12 months of data.")
        
        # Find the index of the month with the highest sales
        highest_sales_index = sales_data.index(max(sales_data))
        
        # List of month names
        months = [
            "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
            "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"
        ]
        
        # Return the name of the month with the highest sales
        return months[highest_sales_index]
    
    # Example usage:
    sales_data = [1500.0, 2000.5, 2500.0, 3000.75, 3500.0, 4000.25,
                  4500.0, 5000.5, 5500.0, 6000.75, 6500.0, 7000.25]
    
    highest_month = month_with_highest_sales(sales_data)
    print(f"The month with the highest sales is: {highest_month}")
    ```
    
    ### Explanation:
    1. The function `month_with_highest_sales` checks if the input list has exactly 12 elements. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
    2. It finds the index of the maximum sales value using the `max()` function and the `index()` method.
    3. It defines a list of month names corresponding to the indices.
    4. Finally, it returns the name of the month with the highest sales. 
    
    You can test the function with different sales data to see which month has the highest sales.
