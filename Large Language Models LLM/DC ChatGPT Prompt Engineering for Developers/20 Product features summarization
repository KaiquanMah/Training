Product features summarization
An electronics review website wants to provide concise and easy-to-read summaries of product features for its readers, allowing them to compare and evaluate different products quickly. The review website wants to generate bullet-point summaries, and, to start with, they want you to craft a prompt that summarizes a product_description for a smartphone.
The OpenAI package, the product_description, and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.


Craft a prompt that summarizes the product_description in no more than five bullet points.

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Craft a prompt to summarize the product description
prompt = f"""Summarise the product_description in no more than 5 bullet points.
            ```{product_description}```"""

response = get_response(prompt)

print("Original description: \n", product_description)
