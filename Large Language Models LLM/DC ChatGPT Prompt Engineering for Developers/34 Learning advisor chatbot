Learning advisor chatbot
You are developing a personalized learning advisor chatbot that recommends textbooks for users. The chatbot's role is to receive queries from learners about their background, experience, and goals, and accordingly, recommends a learning path of textbooks, including both beginner-level and more advanced options. Your job is to create a role-playing system_prompt for the textbook recommendation chatbot, highlighting what it is expected to do while interacting with the users.
The OpenAI package, and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.


Define a role-playing system_prompt that tells the bot to act as a learning advisor who can interpret learner queries as described and provide the relevant textbook recommendations.


client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Craft the system_prompt using the role-playing approach
system_prompt = "system: act as a learning advisor who can interpret learner queries as described and provide the relevant textbook recommendations. Learn about user's background, experience, and goals, and accordingly, recommends a learning path of textbooks, including both beginner-level and more advanced options"

user_prompt = "Hello there! I'm a beginner with a marketing background, and I'm really interested in learning about Python, data analytics, and machine learning. Can you recommend some books?"

response = get_response(system_prompt, user_prompt)
print(response)

These skills can significantly enhance your ability to analyze data and make informed decisions. Let's break down your learning path into beginner and more advanced options.
    
    ### Beginner Level
    
    1. **Python Programming:**
       - **"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart**  
         This book is perfect for beginners and focuses on practical programming tasks. It’s very accessible and will help you get comfortable with Python.
    
    2. **Data Analytics:**
       - **"Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney**  
         This book introduces you to data analysis using Python and the pandas library. It’s a great starting point for understanding how to manipulate and analyze data.
    
    3. **Machine Learning:**
       - **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron**  
         While this book is a bit more advanced, it starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually builds up to more complex concepts. It’s practical and includes hands-on projects.


    
    ### Intermediate to Advanced Level
    
    1. **Python Programming:**
       - **"Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho**  
         Once you’re comfortable with the basics, this book dives deeper into Python and its advanced features, which will be beneficial as you progress.
    
    2. **Data Analytics:**
       - **"Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python" by Joel Grus**  
         This book covers the fundamental concepts of data science and machine learning, teaching you how to implement algorithms from scratch using Python.
    
    3. **Machine Learning:**
       - **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop**  
         This is a more theoretical book that provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of machine learning. It’s great for understanding the underlying principles.
    
    ### Additional Resources
    
    - **Online Courses:** Consider supplementing your reading with online courses from platforms like Coursera, edX, or Udacity, which often provide hands-on projects and community support.
    - **Practice Projects:** As you learn, try to apply your skills to real-world data sets, especially those related to marketing, to make the learning process more relevant and engaging.
    
    Feel free to ask if you have any specific areas you want to focus on or if you need further recommendations! Happy learning!
