Input-output examples for code generation
You work as a project manager and need to estimate the time it will take to complete different projects. Your task is to develop a Python function that can predict the estimated completion time for a project based on historical data. You are given a set of examples in the examples string where different factors are associated with project completion time. Each example includes the factors' numerical values and the corresponding estimated completion time.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you, as well as the examples string.


Craft a prompt that asks the model to infer the Python function that maps the inputs to the outputs in the provided examples.

    1. **Explanation of the Examples:**
       The examples provided show a mapping from an input list of integers to a single output integer. To understand how the output is derived from the input, we can analyze the examples:
    
       - For the input `[10, 5, 8]`, the output is `23`. This can be calculated as:
         \[
         10 + 5 + 8 = 23
         \]
       - For the input `[5, 2, 4]`, the output is `11`:
         \[
         5 + 2 + 4 = 11
         \]
       - For the input `[2, 1, 3]`, the output is `6`:
         \[
         2 + 1 + 3 = 6
         \]
       - For the input `[8, 4, 6]`, the output is `18`:
         \[
         8 + 4 + 6 = 18
         \]
    
       From these examples, we can see that the output is simply the sum of the integers in the input list.
    
    2. **Python Function:**
       Based on the analysis, we can create a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of those integers as output.
    
    ```python
    def sum_of_list(input_list):
        return sum(input_list)
    
    # Example usage:
    print(sum_of_list([10, 5, 8]))  # Output: 23
    print(sum_of_list([5, 2, 4]))    # Output: 11
    print(sum_of_list([2, 1, 3]))    # Output: 6
    print(sum_of_list([8, 4, 6]))    # Output: 18
    ```
    
    This function uses Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total of the numbers in the input list.
