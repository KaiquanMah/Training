Customer support ticket routing
A large customer support team receives many tickets related to different business areas, such as technical issues, billing inquiries, and product feedback. Your task is to create a prompt that automatically classifies incoming tickets into these three groups and routes them to the appropriate support specialists, reducing response times and enhancing customer satisfaction. You will test your prompt on a provided sample ticket.
The OpenAI package, the ticket string, and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.


Craft a prompt that classifies the ticket as technical issue, billing inquiry, or product feedback, without providing anything else in the response.

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Craft a prompt to classify the ticket
prompt = f"""Classify ticket enclosed by triple backticks.
             Choose 1 out of the 3 classes: technical issues, billing inquiries, or product feedback. Do not use 'class' keyword inside your response.
             Ticket: ```{ticket}```"""

response = get_response(prompt)

print("Ticket: ", ticket)
print("Class: ", response)


<script.py> output:
    Ticket:  
    Subject: Urgent - Login Error
    
    Hi Support Team,
    
    I'm having trouble accessing my account with the username "example_user." Every time I try to log in, I encounter an error message. I've already attempted to reset my password, but the issue persists. I need to resolve this problem urgently, as I have pending tasks that require immediate attention.
    
    Please investigate and assist promptly.
    
    Thanks,
    John.
