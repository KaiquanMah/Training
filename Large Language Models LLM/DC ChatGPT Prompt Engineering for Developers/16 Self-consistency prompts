Self-consistency prompts
Imagine you own a store that sells laptops and mobile phones. You start your day with 50 devices in the store, out of which 60% are mobile phones. Throughout the day, three clients visited the store, each of them bought one mobile phone, and one of them bought additionally a laptop. Also, you added to your collection 10 laptops and 5 mobile phones. How many laptops and mobile phones do you have by the end of the day? This problem is defined in the problem_to_solve string, and you will use a self-consistency prompt to solve it.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.
The get_response() function in this exercise employs the max_tokens parameter to help this exercise run faster.



Create the self_consistency_instruction that allows the model to solve the problem with three experts and combine the results with a majority vote.
Create the final prompt by combining the self_consistency_instruction and the problem_to_solve.

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Create the self_consistency instruction
self_consistency_instruction = 'Solve the problem with 3 experts. Then combine results through majority vote'

# Create the problem to solve
problem_to_solve = "If you own a store that sells laptops and mobile phones. You start your day with 50 devices in the store, out of which 60% are mobile phones. Throughout the day, three clients visited the store, each of them bought one mobile phone, and one of them bought additionally a laptop. Also, you added to your collection 10 laptops and 5 mobile phones. How many laptops and mobile phones do you have by the end of the day?"

prompt = self_consistency_instruction + problem_to_solve

response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)


Let's break down the problem step by step.
    
    1. **Initial Inventory:**
       - Total devices: 50
       - Percentage of mobile phones: 60%
       - Number of mobile phones: \( 50 \times 0.60 = 30 \)
       - Number of laptops: \( 50 - 30 = 20 \)
    
    2. **Sales:**
       - Three clients bought mobile phones: 
         - Mobile phones sold: 3
       - One of the clients also bought a laptop:
         - Laptops sold: 1
    
       After sales:
       - Remaining mobile phones: \( 30 - 3 = 27 \)
       - Remaining laptops: \( 20 - 1 = 19 \)
    
    3. **Additions to Inventory:**
       - Laptops added: 10
       - Mobile phones added: 5
    
       After additions:
       - Total laptops: \( 19 + 10 = 29 \)
       - Total mobile phones: \( 27 + 5 = 32 \)
    
    4. **Final Inventory:**
       - Laptops: 29
       - Mobile phones: 32
    
    Thus, by the end of the day, you have **29 laptops** and **32 mobile phones**.
