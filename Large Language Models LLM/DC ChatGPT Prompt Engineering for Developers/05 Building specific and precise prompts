Building specific and precise prompts
In the previous exercise, you generated text that completes a given story. Your team was happy with your achievement, however, they want you to follow specific guidelines when it comes to length and style. Your task now is to craft a more specific prompt that controls these aspects of the generated story.
The OpenAI package, the get_response() function, and the same story variable have been pre-loaded for you.


Craft a prompt that completes the given story with only two paragraphs in the style of Shakespeare; use f-string, and delimit the story with triple backticks (```).

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Create a request to complete the story
prompt = f"""Complete the story delimited by triple backticks with only 2 paragraphs in the style of Shakespeare. 
 ```{story}```"""

# Get the generated response
response = get_response(prompt)

print("\n Original story: \n", story)
print("\n Prompt: \n", prompt)
print("\n Generated story: \n", response)

     Generated story: 
     ...Lo! A crystal orb, aglow with hues of azure and gold, did beckon forth from the shadows of the void. With trembling hands, brave Alex grasped the wondrous sphere, and in that moment, the very fabric of time did tremble. Whispers of ancient stars and forgotten realms danced upon the air, revealing secrets long shrouded in the mists of eternity. "What sorcery is this?" quoth Alex, as visions of worlds unseen and destinies entwined unfurled before their eyes, igniting a fire of ambition and dread within their breast.
    
    Yet, as the orb's power surged, a tempest of cosmic winds did rise, threatening to rend the heavens asunder. "O fate most cruel!" lamented Alex, for the orb, a key to realms beyond, bore a price most dire. With courage anew, they resolved to wield this gift, to traverse the celestial tapestry and confront the shadows that lurked therein. Thus, with heart afire and spirit unyielding, Alex set forth upon a path fraught with peril, where the echoes of the past and the whispers of the future entwined, forging a legend that would echo through the stars for all eternity.
