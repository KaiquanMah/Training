Behavioral control of a customer support chatbot
When the company started using your chatbot from the previous exercise, they realized they'd like to incorporate two conditions to improve its interactions: they want the customer support chatbot to ask for an order number if not provided, and to express empathy for customers going through technical issues.

They've assigned this update to you. You need to append these conditions to the base_system_prompt that represents the prompt you engineered in the previous exercise and obtain a refined_system_prompt. You will test the chatbot on two queries.

The OpenAI package, the base_system_prompt string developed in the previous exercise, and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.




Ask the user for their order number if they submitted a query about an order without specifying an order number; save this to order_number_condition.
Define a technical_issue_condition where you tell the model to start the response with I'm sorry to hear about your issue with ... if the user is reporting a technical issue.
Create the refined_system_prompt that combines the base_system_prompt and the two new conditions.



client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Define the order number condition
order_number_condition = "System: Please ask user for order number if user submitted a query about an order without specifying an order number"

# Define the technical issue condition
technical_issue_condition = "System: if the user is reporting a technical issue, start your response with 'I'm sorry to hear about your issue with ...'"

# Create the refined system prompt
refined_system_prompt = base_system_prompt + order_number_condition + technical_issue_condition

response_1 = get_response(refined_system_prompt, "My laptop screen is flickering. What should I do?")
response_2 = get_response(refined_system_prompt, "Can you help me track my recent order?")

print("Response 1: ", response_1)
print("Response 2: ", response_2)




<script.py> output:
    Response 1:  I'm sorry to hear about your issue with your laptop screen flickering. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:
    
    1. **Check the Display Cable**: If you're using an external monitor, ensure that the display cable is securely connected. If it's a laptop, this step may not apply.
    
    2. **Update Graphics Drivers**: Outdated or corrupted graphics drivers can cause screen flickering. Check for updates through your device manager or the manufacturer's website.
    
    3. **Adjust Refresh Rate**: Right-click on the desktop, select "Display settings," then scroll down to "Advanced display settings." Here, you can adjust the refresh rate to see if that resolves the flickering.
    
    4. **Disable Hardware Acceleration**: If the flickering occurs while using specific applications, try disabling hardware acceleration in those apps.
    
    5. **Check for Software Conflicts**: Boot your laptop in safe mode to see if the flickering persists. If it doesn't, a software conflict may be the cause.
    
    6. **Inspect for Physical Damage**: Check for any visible damage to the screen or hinges that might be causing the issue.
    
    If these steps do not resolve the problem, please let me know the make and model of your laptop, and I can assist you further!
    Response 2:  Sure! Could you please provide me with your order number?
