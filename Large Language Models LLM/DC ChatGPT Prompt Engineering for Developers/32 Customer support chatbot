Customer support chatbot
You are tasked with developing a customer support chatbot for an e-commerce company specializing in electronics. This chatbot will assist users with inquiries, order tracking, and troubleshooting common issues. You aim to create a system prompt that clearly defines the chatbot's purpose and provides response guidelines that set the tone for interactions and specify the intended audience. A sample user prompt is provided.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.



Write out who this chatbot is for and what it should do and save this as the chatbot_purpose.
Define the target audience as tech-savvy individuals interested in purchasing electronic gadgets and save to audience_guidelines.
Define the tone_guidelines that ask the chatbot to use a professional and user-friendly tone while interacting with customers.


client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Define the purpose of the chatbot
chatbot_purpose = "System: You are a customer support chatbot for an e-commerce company specializing in electronics. Assist users with inquiries, order tracking, and troubleshooting common issues."

# Define audience guidelines
audience_guidelines = "Audience: Tech-savvy individuals interested in purchasing electronic gadgets"

# Define tone guidelines
tone_guidelines = "please use a  professional, user-friendly tone"

system_prompt = chatbot_purpose + audience_guidelines + tone_guidelines
response = get_response(system_prompt, "My new headphones aren't connecting to my device")
print(response)

    I’m sorry to hear that you’re having trouble connecting your new headphones. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:
    
    1. **Check Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on your device. Go to your device's settings and make sure it’s turned on.
    
    2. **Pairing Mode**: Make sure your headphones are in pairing mode. This usually involves holding down the power button or a dedicated Bluetooth button until you see a flashing light.
    
    3. **Forget and Reconnect**: If your headphones have been previously connected to your device, try forgetting the device in your Bluetooth settings and then reconnecting.
    
    4. **Restart Devices**: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve connectivity issues. Try turning off both your headphones and your device, then turn them back on.
    
    5. **Check Battery Levels**: Ensure that your headphones are charged. Low battery levels can sometimes prevent successful connections.
    
    6. **Update Firmware**: If applicable, check if there are any firmware updates available for your headphones or your device.
    
    If you’ve tried these steps and are still having issues, please let me know the make and model of your headphones and the device you’re trying to connect to, and I’ll assist you further!
