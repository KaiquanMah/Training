Product description expansion
As you continue your work on the electronics review website, you've come across some products that are already summarized but lack a comprehensive description. Your task now is to expand these concise product descriptions into detailed narratives, ensuring that each product has both a full description and a bulleted summary for easy comparison. The complete description should effectively capture the product's unique features, benefits, and potential applications. You will apply your first prompt on a smart home security camera's product description.
The OpenAI package, the product_description string, and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.



Craft a prompt that expands the product_description pre-loaded string, and writes a one paragraph comprehensive overview capturing the key information of the product: unique features, benefits, and potential applications.


client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Craft a prompt to expand the product's description
prompt = f"""Write a one paragraph comprehensive overview capturing the key information of the product: unique features, benefits, and potential applications.
            Product description is as follows: {product_description}
"""

response = get_response(prompt)

print("Original description: \n", product_description)
print("Expanded description: \n", response)
