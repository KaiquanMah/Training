Reasoning with chain-of-thought prompts
Chain-of-thought prompting is helpful to explain the reasoning behind the answer that the model is giving, especially in complex tasks such as generating the solution for a mathematical problem or a riddle. In this exercise, you will craft a chain-of-thought prompt to let the language model guess the age of your friend's father based on some information you will provide.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.




Create a chain-of-thought prompt to determine your friend's father's age in 10 years, given that he is currently twice your friend's age, and your friend is 20.

client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Create the chain-of-thought prompt
prompt = '''Q: Friend A is 11 years old. Her aunt is 3x her age. What is her aunt's age in 5 years time?
            A: Friend's age now = 11
               Aunt's age now = 11 x 3 = 33
               Let us think step by step and check my arithmetic in calculating aunt's age now.
               Time difference I need to find: 5 years in the future
               Aunt's age in 5 years time = 33 + 5 = 38
               Let us think step by step and check my arithmetic in calculating aunt's age in 5 years time.


            Q: If my friend's father is twice my friend's age, and my friend is 20, determine my friend's father's age in 10 years time.'''

response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)




    To determine your friend's father's age in 10 years, let's break it down step by step:
    
    1. **Friend's current age**: 20 years old.
    2. **Father's current age**: Since the father is twice the friend's age, we calculate:
       \[
       \text{Father's age now} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ years old.}
       \]
    3. **Time difference**: We need to find the father's age in 10 years.
    4. **Father's age in 10 years**: We add 10 years to the father's current age:
       \[
       \text{Father's age in 10 years} = 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ years old.}
       \]
    
    So, your friend's father will be 50 years old in 10 years.
