Multi-step prompt to plan a trip
You noticed that the single-step prompt was not effective, because the answer was too vague for what you had in mind. You improve your prompt by specifying the steps to follow for planning. The plan should have four potential locations for your beach vacation, and each location should have some accommodation options, some activities, and an evaluation of the pros and cons.
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.
The get_response() function in this exercise employs the max_tokens parameter to help this exercise run faster.
