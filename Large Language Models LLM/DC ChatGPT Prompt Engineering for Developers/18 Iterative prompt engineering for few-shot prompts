Iterative prompt engineering for few-shot prompts
You are currently working on a project at your content creation company. The project's objective is to develop a text classification model capable of accurately identifying and categorizing different emotions in text, such as happiness, sadness, and fear. In cases where the text does not contain any discernible emotion, you aim for the model to respond with "no explicit emotion."
You decided to use the provided few-shot prompt. However, you've noticed that "Time flies like an arrow" is being incorrectly classified as "surprise." Your objective now is to refine the prompt so that the model correctly classifies this particular example as "no explicit emotion."
The OpenAI package and the get_response() function have been pre-loaded for you.



Iteratively refine the prompt, by refining the examples, to get the output no explicit emotion for the "They sat and ate their meal" example.


client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Refine the following prompt
prompt = """
Receiving a promotion at work made me feel on top of the world -> Happiness
Colleagues finished their work for the day -> Happiness

The movie's ending left me with a heavy feeling in my chest -> Sadness

Walking alone in the dark alley sent shivers down my spine -> Fear
Time flies like an arrow -> no explicit emotion
People were looking at the left before crossing the road -> no explicit emotion
____
____
They sat and ate their meal ->
"""

response = get_response(prompt)
print(response)



<script.py> output:
    Satisfaction
