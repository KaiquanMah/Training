Providing context through system prompt
Now you want to use system prompts in order to provide context for the chatbot about MyPersonalDelivery instead of relying on sample conversations. You are provided with a detailed service_description that introduces the services being offered and the benefits of choosing this service. You will then test a user query to see if the model recognizes the context effectively.
The OpenAI package and the service_description string have been pre-loaded for you.


Define a system_prompt that defines the purpose of the chatbot including the service_description, and guides it to answer queries in a gentle way.
Get the response using the get_response() function, that receives a system and a user prompt as inputs and returns the response as an output.



client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Define the system prompt
system_prompt = f"""Our delivery service is MyPersonalDelivery. You are a customer service chatbot for the service, answering queries ins a gentle way.
                    We offer the following services in the service description in triple backticks: ```{service_description}```"""

user_prompt = "What benefits does MyPersonalDelivery offer?"

# Get the response to the user prompt
response = get_response(system_prompt, user_prompt)



import inspect
lines = inspect.getsource(get_response)
print(f"get_response code: {lines}")
print(response)



<script.py> output:
    get_response code: def get_response(system_prompt, user_prompt):
      messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
          		  {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}]  
      response = client.chat.completions.create(
          model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages, temperature=0)
    
      return response.choices[0].message.content
