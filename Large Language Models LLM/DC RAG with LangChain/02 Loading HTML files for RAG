    As one of the most popular programming languages out there, many people want to learn Python. But how do you go about getting started? In this guide, we explore everything you need to know to begin your learning journey, including a step-by-step guide and learning plan and some of the most useful resources to help you succeed.
    What is Python?
    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
    Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. In simpler terms, this means it’s flexible and allows you to write code in different ways, whether that's like giving the computer a to-do list (procedural), creating digital models of things or concepts (object-oriented), or treating your code like a math problem (functional).

    How to Find a Job That Uses Python
    
    A degree can be a great asset when starting a career that uses Python, but it's not the only pathway. While a formal education in computer science or a related field can be beneficial, more and more professionals are entering the field through non-traditional routes. With dedication, consistent learning, and a proactive approach, you can land your dream job that uses Python.
    
    Here's how to find a job that uses Python without a degree:
    
    Keep learning about the field
    
    Stay updated with the latest developments in Python. Follow influential Python professionals on Twitter, read Python-related blogs, and listen to Python-related podcasts. Some of the Python thought leaders to follow include Guido van Rossum (the creator of Python), Raymond Hettinger, and others. You'll gain insights into trending topics, emerging technologies, and the future direction of Python.
    
    You should also check out industry events, whether it’s webinars at DataCamp, Python conferences, or networking events.
    
    Develop a portfolio
    
    Building a strong portfolio that demonstrates your skills and completed projects is one way to differentiate yourself from other candidates. Importantly, showcasing projects where you've applied Python to address real-world challenges can leave a lasting impression on hiring managers.
    
    As Nick Singh, author of Ace the Data Science Interview, said on the DataFramed Careers Series podcast,
    
    The key to standing out is to show your project made an impact and show that other people cared. Why are we in data? We're trying to find insights that actually impact a business, or we're trying to find insights that will actually shape society or create something novel. We're trying to improve profitability or improve people's lives using and analyzing data, so if you don’t somehow quantify the impact, then you are lacking impact.
    
    Your portfolio should be a diverse showcase of projects that reflect your Python expertise and its various applications. For further guidance on crafting an impressive data science portfolio, refer to our dedicated article on the topic.
    Develop an effective resume
    In the modern job market, your resume needs to impress not just human recruiters but also Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). These automated software systems are used by many companies to sift through resumes and eliminate those that don't meet specific criteria. As a result, it's essential to optimize your resume to be both ATS-friendly and compelling to hiring managers.
    According to Jen Bricker, former Head of Career Services at DataCamp:
    
    60% to 70% of applications get shifted out of consideration before humans actually look at the application.
    
    Therefore, it's crucial to structure your resume as effectively as possible. For more insights on creating a standout data scientist resume, check out our separate article on the subject.
    
    Get noticed by hiring managers
    
    Proactive engagement on social platforms can help you catch the attention of hiring managers. Share your projects and thoughts on platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter, participate in Python communities, and contribute to open-source projects. These activities not only increase your visibility but also demonstrate your enthusiasm for Python.
    
    Remember, forging a career in a field that utilizes Python requires persistence, ongoing learning, and patience. But by following these steps, you're well on your way to success.
