Fetching vectors
In this exercise, you've been provided with a list of ids containing IDs of different records in your 'datacamp-index' index. You'll use these IDs to retrieve the associated records and explore their metadata.


Initialize the Pinecone connection with your API key.
Retrieve the vectors with IDs in the ids list from the connected index.
Create a list of dictionaries containing the metadata from each record in fetched_vectors.




# Initialize the Pinecone client with your API key
pc = Pinecone(api_key="apikey")

index = pc.Index('datacamp-index')
ids = ['2', '5', '8']

# Fetch the vectors from the connected Pinecone index
fetched_vectors = index.fetch(ids=ids)

# Extract the metadata from each result in fetched_vectors
metadatas = [fetched_vectors['vectors'][id]['metadata'] for id in ids]
print(metadatas)


<script.py> output:
    [{'genre': 'comedy', 'year': 2004.0}, {'genre': 'thriller', 'year': 2001.0}, {'genre': 'action', 'year': 2017.0}]
