Defining a function for chunking
To be able to batch upserts in a reproducible way, you'll need to define a function to split your list of vectors into chunks.
The built-in itertools module has already been imported for you.


Convert the iterable input into an iterator.
Slice it into chunks of size batch_size using the itertools module.
Yield the current chunk.


def chunks(iterable, batch_size=100):
    """A helper function to break an iterable into chunks of size batch_size."""
    # Convert the iterable into an iterator
    it = iter(iterable)
    # Slice the iterator into chunks of size batch_size
    chunk = tuple(itertools.islice(it, batch_size))
    while chunk:
        # Yield the chunk
        yield chunk
        chunk = tuple(itertools.islice(it, batch_size))
