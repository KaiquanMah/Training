Deleting an index
If you have an index that has gone stale, perhaps it's time to delete it! Deleting an index will also delete all of the data it contains, so be cautious when doing this in your own projects!


Initialize the Pinecone connection with your API key.
Delete the index you've been working with: "my-first-index".
List your indexes to verify it has been deleted.


# Set up the client with your API key
pc = Pinecone(api_key="pcsk_4253vh_A7C4i7vfT1rtFL9TwdtknNuNJGY3d3wi38Mnna6y75ZQhRbckdYJYa65sfV7hU7")

# Delete your Pinecone index
pc.delete_index('my-first-index')

# List your indexes
print(pc.list_indexes())




<script.py> output:
    {'indexes': []}
