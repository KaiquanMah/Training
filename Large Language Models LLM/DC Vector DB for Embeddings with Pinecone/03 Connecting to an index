Connecting to an index
To begin ingesting vectors and performing vector manipulations in your newly-created Pinecone index, you'll first need to connect to it! The resulting index object has a number of methods for ingesting, manipulating, and exploring the contents of the index in Python.
The Pinecone class has already been imported for you, and will be available throughout the course.

Initialize the Pinecone connection with your API key.
Connect to the "my-first-index" index.
Print key statistics about the index using an index method.


# Set up the client with your API key
pc = Pinecone(api_key="apikey")

# Connect to your index
index = pc.Index("my-first-index")

# Print the index statistics
print(index.describe_index_stats())


<script.py> output:
    {'dimension': 256,
     'index_fullness': 0.0,
     'namespaces': {},
     'total_vector_count': 0}
