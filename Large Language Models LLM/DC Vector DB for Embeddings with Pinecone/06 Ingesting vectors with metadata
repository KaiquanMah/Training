Ingesting vectors with metadata
It's ingesting time! You'll be ingesting vectors, which is a list of dictionaries containing the vector values, IDs, and associated metadata. They're already been provided in a format that can be directly inserted into the index without further manipulation.

Here's another reminder about the structure of vectors.
vectors = [
    {
        "id": "0",
        "values": [0.025525547564029694, ..., 0.0188823901116848]
        "metadata": {"genre": "action", "year": 2024}
    },
        ...,
]



Initialize the Pinecone connection with your API key.
Connect to your index called "datacamp-index".
Upsert vectors to the index.
Print the index's descriptive statistics.


# Initialize the Pinecone client with your API key
pc = Pinecone(api_key="apikey")

# Connect to your index
index = pc.Index("datacamp-index")

# Ingest the vectors and metadata
index.upsert(vectors=vectors)

# Print the index statistics
print(index.describe_index_stats())



<script.py> output:
    {'dimension': 1536,
     'index_fullness': 0.0,
     'namespaces': {},
     'total_vector_count': 0}
